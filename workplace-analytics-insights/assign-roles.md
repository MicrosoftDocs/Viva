# Assign roles

After assigning licenses, you need to assign roles to the people who want to view and use Microsoft Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams. You can assign users the role of **Insights Administrator** or **Insights Business Leader** in Microsoft 365 admin center.

To assign roles:

1. Sign in as a global admin to your tenant's [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal).
2. In the left navigation, select **Roles**, and then select the **Microsoft Entra ID** tab.
3. In the search field, enter **Viva Insights**.
4. In the search results, select a role:

   * **Insights Administrator** - Gets full access to the Viva Insights app and read access to Microsoft Entra properties, monitors, service health, and managed service requests.
   * **Insights Business Leader** - Gets read access to the Viva Insights app reports and data.

5. Select **Assign admins**, and then select **+ Add**.
6. In the search field for **Who do you want to assign to this role**, type the first few letters of a name, and then select the name from the list. The admin center limits you to assigning 20 names at a time. However, you can repeat these steps to assign more users a role.

7. Select **Save** to assign the listed users the role.

>[!Note]
>The Microsoft 365 admin center references all roles as admins even though not all roles are admins.
