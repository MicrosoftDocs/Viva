# Accelerate change insights

*This experience is only available through private preview at this time.*

> [!Important]
> This insight is only available in organizations who have at least 200 licensed users. If your organization has fewer than that, you'll see the following alert for **Accelerate change**: "This insight is unavailable because the minimum number of employees is not met."

Slow adoption of new technology harms efforts to attract and retain top talent, improve productivity, and can lead to market failure. Influencers are employees who have the best connections to people across the company based on their collaboration patterns.

Engage influencers shows how your organization compares with others based on industry research and your specific organizational data.

## Calculations

The percentage metric for **Engage influencers** is **Percentage of employees who can drive change within your workforce**. This is the percentage of employees who are one step away from influencers. Influencers are the people with the best connections across the company.

The visual behavioral insight for **Engage influencers** is **Reach of influencers**, which is an [organizational network graph](glossary.md#ona-define) that shows the [influencers](glossary.md#influencer-define), their connections, and how they effectively connect across your organization. This helps you identify and target the people who power the unobservable communication networks that can drive change.

## Take action

In the **Take action** section for each insight, select **See your insights** to see the most effective actions you can do now to drive change toward better business outcomes in your organization.

You also might see one or more groups listed who are affected and would benefit the most from these recommendations, which are based on your organizational data and industry research.

## Best practices

Leveraging the right people to promote new technology can help drive adoption at scale. Well-connected people share information efficiently, but are not always easy to identify.

The [Measuring your employees’ invisible forms of influence](https://insights.office.com/productivity/measuring-your-employees-invisible-forms-of-influence/) article says that "traditional organizational reporting structures limit managers’ visibility into how their employees are influencing and contributing to other teams. New workplace metrics are needed to help leaders get a more complete picture of this." Ways to leverage influencers:

* Use [Microsoft Viva Insights](/viva/insights/personal/use/use-the-insights) and the [Network](/viva/insights/personal/use/network) page to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections and cultivate influence.
* Use [Microsoft Teams channels](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive conversations.
