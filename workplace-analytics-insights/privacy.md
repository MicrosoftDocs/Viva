# Data privacy

*This experience is only available through private preview at this time.*

>[!Important]
>Starting in March 2022, this product will no longer be available. You can access the same insights with [Microsoft Viva Insights](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/insights/).

Microsoft Insights produce powerful analysis about how your organization functions. It does this by analyzing Microsoft 365 collaboration data and organizational data already present in Microsoft Entra ID.

Given the potential sensitivity about how data could be used, successful implementation and use of Insights requires careful thought and planning regarding data protection.  

When data is processed for Insights, Microsoft protects privacy and fully complies with applicable local regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Insights protect privacy in the following ways:

* **Everyone's data is kept private by default** - Insights are based on aggregated data and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual in your organization. The analysis and actions are based on information generated by you and your organization just by going about your regular workday. Additionally, no group data is shown for groups less than the configured minimum group size, which the *minimum allowed value* is *10* people.
* **GDPR compliant** – Microsoft complies with the GDPR when providing Insights. To learn more, see [GDPR compliance](https://www.microsoft.com/trustCenter/privacy/gdpr).

This basic overview about data privacy is not intended as a substitute for addressing your organization’s unique needs by engaging with legal, privacy, human-resources, and other subject matter experts within your organization.
