|---------|--------|----------|------------|
|Enable deep work |Distribution of time for deep work |Percentage of employees grouped by their [focus time](metrics.md#focus-define). The groups are divided into those who spend between 0 and 10 hours, 10 and 20 hours, 20 and 40 hours, and more than 40 hours focusing. The percentages are calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period. |
|Utilize influencers |Organizations with limited influencers |Percentage organizations that don't have sufficient representation of influencers, based on company size. This uses the [influence](metrics.md#influence-define) metric.|

This section describes why each of the following behaviors matter and the top best practices that can help foster innovation.

* [Enable deep work](#enable-deep-work)
* [Utilize influencers](#utilize-influencers)

<!-- ### Foster cross-group collaboration

Collaboration across organizational boundaries enables the learning and idea formation required for innovation. [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) explains that work "occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."

Ways to create opportunities for cross-group collaboration:

* Create cross-functional [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) to build community and communicate, share information, and brainstorm about projects.
* Give teams an opportunity to join cross-functional teams to compete in an innovation challenge around a key business challenge.

For more best practices and how to create goals across teams or departments, see [Best practices for cross-group collaboration](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/tutorials/gm-cgcollaboration).

## Enable deep work

Time without meetings, emails and chats provides employees with the opportunity to complete challenging work, think creatively and generate innovative ideas.

[How to establish a meeting-free day each week](https://insights.office.com/time-management/how-to-establish-a-meeting-free-day-each-week/) explains the "goal is uninterrupted focus" time to work "on projects that require focus and high-level thinking..." Ways to support focus time:

* Follow a team norm to not send chats to team members who have scheduled focus time or have the focusing status showing in Microsoft Teams.
* Use a [MyAnalytics Focus plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/focus-plan) to automatically book focus time, protect this time by silencing chats, and track weekly progress.

For more best practices and ways to establish a 'no meeting' period, see [Best practices for focus time](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/tutorials/gm-focus).

## Utilize influencers

Influencers are people within an organization who are well connected and can drive innovation by efficiently sharing information with others.

The [Measuring your employees’ invisible forms of influence](https://insights.office.com/productivity/measuring-your-employees-invisible-forms-of-influence/) article says that "traditional organizational reporting structures limit managers’ visibility into how their employees are influencing and contributing to other teams. New workplace metrics are needed to help leaders get a more complete picture of this." Ways to leverage influencers:

* Use [Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/use-the-insights) and the [Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/network) page to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections and cultivate influence.
* Use [Microsoft Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive conversations.
