## Best practices

This section describes why each of the following behaviors matter and the top best practices that can help foster innovation.

* [Enable deep work](#enable-deep-work)
* [Utilize influencers](#utilize-influencers)

## Enable deep work

Time without meetings, emails and chats provides employees with the opportunity to complete challenging work, think creatively and generate innovative ideas.

[How to establish a meeting-free day each week](https://insights.office.com/time-management/how-to-establish-a-meeting-free-day-each-week/) explains the "goal is uninterrupted focus" time to work "on projects that require focus and high-level thinking..." Ways to support focus time:

* Follow a team norm to not send chats to team members who have scheduled focus time or have the focusing status showing in Microsoft Teams.
* Use a [personal focus plan](/viva/insights/personal/use/focus-plan) to automatically book focus time, protect this time by silencing chats, and track weekly progress.

For more best practices and ways to establish a 'no meeting' period, see [Best practices for focus time](/viva/insights/tutorials/gm-focus).

## Utilize influencers

Influencers are people within an organization who are well connected and can drive innovation by efficiently sharing information with others.

The [Measuring your employees’ invisible forms of influence](https://insights.office.com/productivity/measuring-your-employees-invisible-forms-of-influence/) article says that "traditional organizational reporting structures limit managers’ visibility into how their employees are influencing and contributing to other teams. New workplace metrics are needed to help leaders get a more complete picture of this." Ways to leverage influencers:

* Use [Insights](/viva/insights/personal/use/use-the-insights) and the [Network](/viva/insights/personal/use/network) page to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections and cultivate influence.
* Use [Microsoft Teams channels](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive conversations.
