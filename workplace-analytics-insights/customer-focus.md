* [Optimize time with customers](#optimize-time-with-customers)
* [Promote coaching and development](#promote-coaching-and-development)

### Optimize time with customers

Collaboration with customers and other external contacts enables employees to gain the customer and market knowledge needed for business success. Spending time collaborating with customers helps you better anticipate customer's needs and develop products and services that create real value.

To support customer focus:

* Use the [Important people list](/viva/insights/personal/use/use-the-insights#add-important-people) for key external contacts, which enables immediate notification of email from them, more efficient responses to their requests, and reminders to schedule time to connect with them.
* Create a shared [Teams channel](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) with key customers for direct, informal chats and prompt responses to urgent requests.

For best practices and how to track time with your most important external contacts, see [Best practices for customer collaboration](/viva/insights/tutorials/gm-cust-collab).

### Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition.

* Use [Insights](/viva/insights/personal/use/use-the-insights#catch-up-with-your-team) to schedule 1:1 time, receive reminders to do so, and follow up on tasks related to direct reports.
* Require managers to schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with their direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal.
