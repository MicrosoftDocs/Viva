# Viva Insights introduction

*This experience is only available through private preview at this time*

>[!Important]
>Starting in March 2022, this product will no longer be available. You can access the same insights with [Microsoft Viva Insights](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/insights/).

The Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams is part of [Microsoft Viva](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva). Microsoft Viva is the employee experience platform built on Microsoft 365 that helps people and teams be their best from wherever they work. Microsoft Viva brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights into an employee experience that integrates seamlessly into the apps you use every day, such as Microsoft Teams.

Viva Insights in Microsoft 365 help people and businesses thrive with data-driven, privacy-protected insights, and recommendations to improve productivity and wellbeing.

This new release is currently limited to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 E5 or E3 plan subscribers through your Microsoft service representative.

You can request access and get more information at [Microsoft insights](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/workplace-analytics). Select **Contact us** and complete the form to request access and get more information about Insights.

After your admin has completed the [Setup steps](./setup.md), the data for insights might take up to three days to process and become available. After the data is processed and your admin has deployed the Viva Insights app for your organization, you can view advanced insights about your team and organization within Microsoft Teams. Follow the steps in [Install and pin](install.md) to locate and use Viva Insights within Teams.

## Personal insights

You can view Personal insights that only you can see. Insights about how you work and what you could change to do your best work. Useful recommendations, such as protecting time in the day for regular breaks, focused work, and learning that help improve wellbeing and boost productivity. For details, see [Personal Viva Insights](/insights/teams-app).

## Team insights

Manager insights provide much-needed visibility into work patterns that might lead to burnout and stress. These include regular after-hours work, meeting overload, or too little focus time. Managers can use these insights to help their teams strike a balance between productivity and wellbeing.

These insights make it easy for managers to understand current team norms and take action to create positive change. For details, see [My team in Viva Insights](myteam.md).

## Organizational insights

Organizational insights help business leaders to address critical questions about organizational resiliency and work culture with insight into how work impacts their people and their business.

These help leaders take steps to protect employee wellbeing and see opportunities where a change in process could improve business outcomes. For details, see [My organization in Viva Insights](myorg.md).
