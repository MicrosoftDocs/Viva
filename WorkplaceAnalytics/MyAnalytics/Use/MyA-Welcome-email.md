# MyAnalytics welcome message

Up to four weeks after the administrator assigns licenses with the MyAnalytics service to users, they'll receive a Welcome message from MyAnalytics in their Outlook inbox.

Users do not receive the Welcome digest outside of their work week. For example, if necessary, the delivery is delayed to Monday to keep it from being delivered during a weekend.

The following is an example of a MyAnalytics welcome message.
