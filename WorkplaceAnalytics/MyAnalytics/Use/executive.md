# Executive insights

As an executive, your time is your key asset, and meetings are an important factor in your time management. You need to understand how your time is being spent within and outside your organization. The Executive dashboard provides a bird's eye view of your time allocation both to you and to an assistant who has delegate access to your Outlook calendar.

The purpose of the Executive insights dashboard is time management, which is your primary tool for staying focused on your many and various commitments. 

This dashboard shows you your time spent in meetings by category and lets you dive deeper into categories of your choice. By associating each meeting category with a priority, you can determine whether you've been spending the right time across your various priorities. You can view this data over varying periods of time, up to one year in the past.

Before you use the Executive dashboard, you or an assistant should categorize your meetings in Microsoft Outlook. The dashboard can then use these categories to present relevant information about your meetings in tables and charts.

### Access to the Executive dashboard

Access to the dashboad is based on either of two things: executive status as determined by the organizational hierarchy, or possession of delegate access to an executive's mailbox. 

* **Executives and senior leadership** &ndash; Who is considered an "executive"? Based on analysis of Azure Active Directory records, an executive is someone who has a reporting structure of least 200 employees and is above at least two levels of managers.

* **Delegate access** &ndash; Delegate access is typically granted to an executive admin or chief of staff (CoS), but for the purposes of this dashboard, it can be any person who has been granted [delegate access](https://support.microsoft.com/office/allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-41c40c04-3bd1-4d22-963a-28eafec25926) to the executive's Outlook calendar.

## The Executive insights page

The Executive insights help you reflect on how effectively you spend your time in meetings. This page contains the following sections:  

### Percentage breakdown

In a chart, this section shows the relative amount of time that you spent in meetings of different categories.

In the chart, select a category to find out more.     

### Meeting trends and meeting details

The Meeting habits section of the Executive dashboard highlights your habits or practices in meetings that you organized and accepted. This information is shown in either of two charts:

* Select **Meeting Details** to see data about your meeting habits based on the meetings on your calendar over the past four weeks. It helps you understand the number of times each of these meeting types occur out of the total number of meetings on your Outlook calendar.

* Select **Meeting Trends** to see trends of different meeting categories across time:

## Monthly digest email for executives

If you are an executive, the monthly digest email includes a section that provides a preview of the insights that your Executive dashboard will show. For easy access, this email offers a link to the dashboard. 

If you are a person with delegate access, the monthly digest email includes not only your own content, but an additional section for each executive for whom you have delegate access. These executive sections duplicate the insights that the executive sees in their monthly digest email.

## Configure Executive insights

### Categorize meetings in Outlook

It is important that the executive or an assistant [categorize the executive's meetings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/assign-a-color-category-to-a-calendar-appointment-meeting-or-event-750596d9-707d-4412-8c0e-7fdc0fc52527) in Outlook. 

If fewer than four meeting categories are defined or if the more than 75% of your meetings are uncategorized, you will be prompted to categorize your meetings.

> [!Note] 
> If you color-code one meeting of a series &mdash; say, one 1:1 meeting with a direct report &mdash; all of the meetings of that series are categorized at once. They will all show up with the assigned color in your Outlook calendar.

### Configure the dashboard views

You can configure the views by selecting the time frame and the meeting categories to examine. 

#### Select time frame

Select a value from the choices **Last 4 weeks**, **Last 3 months**, or **Last 4 quarters**. This determines the time frame about which the rest of the page will show information. The default value is three months; this is the time frame that's in place when you first open the Executive dashboard.

#### Select meeting categories

 * Under **Select meeting categories**, select categories of meetings to include on this dashboard: 

   ![meeting view slider control](../../Images/mya/use/select-meeting-categories.png)

After you select categories, they appear in all the charts of this page: [Percentage breakdown](#percentage-breakdown), [Meeting trends, and Meeting details](#meeting-trends-and-meeting-details).

## Which meetings are included?

The Executive dashboard does not report on every event in the executive's Outlook calendar. It generally includes all meetings, but note the following cases: 

### Included 

 * Personal appointments such as time set aside for a soccer game, are included in the dashboard view.

### Excluded 

The following kinds of meetings are excluded from view, by default, in the dashboard:

 * Meetings marked as private 
 * All-day meetings 
 * Meetings marked as free time
 * Time marked as Out of office
