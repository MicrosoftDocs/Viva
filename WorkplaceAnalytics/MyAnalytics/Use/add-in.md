Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum? 

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done. 

## Insights that you might see 

Launch the Outlook add-in by selecting the swirl icon in the ribbon. If you are using Outlook Web App, first open an email message and then select the swirl icon in the top-right corner of your email message, next to the **Reply** button.

After you launch the add-in, the insights cards are displayed in the right panel:
