## Tips for sustaining change 

Rewards are critical to habit formation. We all have heard about how animals such as rats, dogs, and monkeys can learn new behaviors in labs when given rewards such as food. Human beings are no different from other animals when it comes to habit formation.

In his book _The Power of Habit_, Charles Duhigg describes the habit-formation process as a three-step loop. “First there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is a routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.”

Rewards can come in many forms and can be delivered in many ways. Structures, processes, systems, target setting, and incentives all offer ways to reinforce and embed the changes that you want. The challenge is selecting the right reinforcement mechanism. The way a reward is delivered also matters – timing of rewards and perceptions of fairness also impact effectiveness 
 ([The Four Building Blocks of Change](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-four-building-blocks--of-change)).

Linking behaviors to performance reviews and thus to financial incentives is an obvious choice, but often financial incentives are less effective than we expect and can even undermine intrinsic motivation. Small, unexpected rewards can have outsided effects. Try the following techniques to reward, recognize, and reinforce behavior change and sustain program results:

 * Periodically and publicly recognize a member of your team for demonstrating healthy collaboration habits, and explicitly state the reason they were selected – for example, for always including an agenda in meeting invites. Consider combining this recognition with a reward such as a gift certificate to an awesome new restaurant. Here are some additional tips on [how to reward and recognize your team](https://uniquelyhr.com/blog/rewards-and-recognition-how-to-show-appreciation-to-your-team/).
 * Make a routine of sharing stories at team meetings about how healthier collaboration habits have enhanced performance and culture. For example, a reduction in after hours has enabled team members to attend more family events in the evening.
 * Restructure a current highly visible system or process, such as a weekly team meeting or periodic business review, to reflect new team-collaboration norms. 
 * Require managers and executive sponsors to commit to consistently and visibly role-modeling new behaviors.
 * Continue to offer learning opportunities – for example, send articles about healthy work habits and offer specific additional training around meeting facilitation or writing.
 * Share the link to [MyAnalytics Individual adoption](Indiv-adopt-get-started.md) with your team so that they can continue to use MyAnalytics on their own to sustain new habits and build additional ones.
