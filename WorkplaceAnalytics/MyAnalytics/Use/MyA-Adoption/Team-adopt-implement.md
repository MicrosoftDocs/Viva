# Implement

## Kickoff meeting

The kickoff meeting is the first event in your program, following the program launch email, and should be scheduled for at least one hour. 

Start with the following (sample) agenda:

* MyAnalytics product overview
* MyAnalytics team behavior change program overview
* MyAnalytics demo
* Survey results
* Goal-setting discussion
* Schedule and next steps
* Additional resources

<!-- REMOVING LINK TO THIS VIDEO FOR NOW:  
 
To learn how to demo MyAnalytics, watch the following video: 
 * [MyAnalytics Product Demo Video](https://microsoft-my.point-df.com/:v:/p/kanowak/EYFZLC62BJ1EvTwS8jzCIfYBNEebAlLC5PErmUitaxl0yw?e=DRAw5g)

 -->
 
Build your kickoff presentation based on the agenda and make sure to include the program purpose statement and team roles and responsibilities in the program overview. Post your kickoff presentation <!-- and the MyAnaltyics Product Demo video -->on your collaboration channel to allow participants to easily access <!--them-->it.

## Goal setting

When a group of individuals attempt to change habits together, a team goal increases the likelihood of success. When a team goal does not exist, individual efforts to change can be blocked by coworkers who either lack understanding or behave in a counterproductive manner. A focused team goal also makes it easier to measure the results of a change program.

We use the following methods to set a team-program goal:

* [Pre-program survey](Team-adopt-plan.md#pre-program-survey)
* Team discussion
* Goal-setting survey

The pre-program survey highlights collaboration pain points and productivity improvements. The survey results might clearly point to a goal, but if the survey results are inconclusive, use a team discussion to gain more context and reactions from program participants to inform the choice of goal.

You can add a team discussion to the program kickoff meeting agenda for this purpose. Have the team discuss the pre-program survey results together. Highlight any inconsistencies or points of confusion in the survey results and solicit feedback from the group about them. Focus on the behavior-change objectives from the survey to help you articulate team goals. Even when the pre-program survey results clearly point to a program goal, a team discussion can create transparency and bolster support for the goal.

To develop a measurable goal, pair a behavior-change objective with a corresponding MyAnalytics metric. Goals phrased in percentage terms are helpful when a group is comprised of individuals with different work behaviors and it is difficult to agree on absolute metrics.

The following table provides some examples of specific goals:

| Objective	| MyAnalytics metric  |	Goal example |
| ------	| -----  |	----- |
| Reduce the number of hours that I spend in ineffective meetings |	<li>Meeting hours <li>Number of hours in conflicting meetings<li>Number of hours in multitasking meetings<li>Number of hours in longer meetings<li>Number of hours in recurring meetings<li>Number of hours in after-hours meetings | Reduce hours in multitasking meetings by 50% |
| Schedule more focus hours to boost my productivity, creativity, and decision-making | <li>Focus hours<li>Focus-hours-to-meeting-hours ratio (use the focus habits chart in your dashboard) |	Spend an equal amount of time in meetings and focus sessions |
Manage my inbox more effectively | <li>Email hours<li>Number of emails sent and/or received during and outside of business hours<!--<li>Hours writing emails<li>Hours sending email--> | Send zero emails outside of business hours |
Improve the effectiveness of the emails I send | <li>Email hours<li>Number of emails sent and/or received during and outside of business hours<!--<li>Hours writing emails<li>Hours sending emails--> | Reduce the number of emails sent by 25% |
Reduce my after-hours collaboration to achieve a better work-life balance | <li>After hours<li>Emails sent/received outside business hours<li>Hours in after-hours meetings	| Spend less than 1 hour per week collaborating outside of business hours | 
Spend more time with the people in my network who are aligned with my top priorities | "My network" metrics:<li>Meeting time <li>Response rate<li>Read rate<li>1:1 meetings | Spend two more hours per week with select important contacts (that is, move a person from "right to left" in your "My network" map in your dashboard) |

The team goal discussion should result in an appropriate goal for the team. If only the goal-focus area is defined by the end of the meeting and not the specifics though, send a brief goal-setting survey after the meeting in which you ask a few questions to confirm the goal area and a measurable target.

Here is an example of a goal-setting survey:

* Do you agree with the team goal to add more focus time every week? Yes/No
* If no, please explain why not.
* Please select what percentage the team should aim to add: 40%, 50%, or other

Seek additional feedback from team members who do not agree with the team goal. Make sure that these people are heard, and think carefully about ways to integrate their feedback into the program (see [Manage Resistance](Team-adopt-implement.md#manage-resistance)).

## Data sharing

After a team goal is defined, collect baseline data from each participant. Because MyAnalytics is designed for individuals, it cannot generate team-level reports. If team-level reports are critical to your program, the Microsoft Workplace Analytics product can support those reports. In the absence of Workplace Analytics, the most efficient way to collect this data is to request it in your surveys.

**To collect baseline data**

Ask program participants to follow these instructions:

1. Look at the **Focus** page in your MyAnalytics dashboard and write down the most recent measures for the specified goal metric – for example, percentages of focus time per week.
2. Send the average to the program manager to calculate and share the team average.

During this process, emphasize to participants that, to protect their privacy, their data will be aggregated and not shared at the individual level. Only the program manager will view the data at the individual level.

At the end of the program, repeat the same process as a part of your post-program survey.

## Learning modules

A Learning module is a collection of materials focused on a collaboration topic to help the team develop new habits and to better understand how to use MyAnalytics. Learning modules include healthy behavior suggestions, Habit playbooks, tips on how to interpret MyAnalytics data and use product features, links to articles to learn more about specific topics, and fun behavioral science lessons. 

What follows are modules about: focus hours, meetings, and email data. You can also find lessons in these modules on how to maintain important relationships in your network.

* [MyAnalytics Focus hours](MyAnalytics-focus-hours-september-2018.pdf)
* [MyAnalytics Meetings](MyAnalytics-meetings-september-2018.pdf)
* [MyAnalytics Email](MyAnalytics-email-september-2018.pdf)
* [MyAnalytics After hours](MyAnalytics-after-hours-september-2018.pdf)

Typically, a program manager sends a Learning module to their team every other week. Choose an order that best matches your team goals and program objectives. You can bundle the learning module with a corresponding [team norms survey](Team-adopt-plan.md#team-norms-survey). Program participants should complete the survey after they have had time to process the contents of the Learning module and experiment with suggested behaviors using the habit-building method.

## Habit-building method

Below is a habit-building method based on behavioral science that can be used to help your team turn a selected behavior into a habit using MyAnalytics.

## Habit playbooks

Habit playbooks are examples of how to use MyAnalytics to turn specific behaviors into habits using the Habit-building method. The playbooks leverage [microlearning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlearning), a method of learning through bite-sized lessons. They are compatible with microlearning since the key to building new habits is simplicity and starting small. BJ Fogg, PhD, a behavioral scientist at Stanford University who has studied behavior change for over two decades, said that “baby steps” are one of the only things what will change behavior in the long term.

Each habit playbook provides a suggested behavior to turn into a habit, an explanation of why the habit is important, and a goal-oriented plan using MyAnalytics to build the habit. You can use the playbooks to design a friendly competition to engage participants, and provide prizes and recognition to team members who achieve the playbook goals. The experiences and results make for a great check-in-meeting topic, too.

* [Habit Playbook Examples](Habit-playbook-examples.pdf). You can try out this collection of playbooks. These examples represent only a small sample of the possible playbooks that could exist.

  > [!Note]
  > These playbooks can also be found in the [Learning modules](Adopt-Learning-Modules.md).

* [Habit Playbook Template](Habit-playbook-template.pptx). Create your own custom playbooks for your team using the template provided.

## Check-ins

In your check-in meetings, you and the program participants can discuss program learnings, MyAnalytics, and the experience in general. Set a frequency that works best for your team. Typically, a bi-weekly cadence is sufficiently frequent. Alternatively, you can dedicate part of the agenda of an existing team meeting for these check-ins. The recommended duration time is 15-30 minutes, depending on the agenda and size of the team. Meetings can be held virtually, in-person, or a mix of both depending on where team members are located.

Start with the following sample check-in meeting agenda:

* What is going well? What could go even better?
* Product and program questions
* Habit playbook results
* Agree on takeaways to document and share with the team

Contact program participants a day or two ahead of the scheduled meeting to ask if there are topics that they want to discuss. This gives you time to prepare to ensure that the meeting is efficient and keeps to the allocated meeting time. To prevent questions from dominating the check-in agenda, remind program participants that they can ask product and program questions at any time on the collaboration channel.

If you are running a large program and the program participants are divided into sub-groups that attend separate check-ins, ask each group to post key takeaways from the check-in to the collaboration channel to keep the broader team informed of progress and to support active conversations on the collaboration channel.

## Manage resistance

In every change program, you can expect some resistance from program participants. This is true even when the whole group initially supports the change. Change is not a linear process. People who experience change but crave the status quo will face setbacks when their motivation wanes or when they stumble upon obstacles. This is another reason to frequently reiterate the purpose of your program to keep it top of mind for participants.

Sally Blount and Shana Carroll from the Kellogg School of Management define the three primary reasons for resistance:

1. Disagreement about the program design
2. The human need for respect, which heightens during change
3. The feeling of being rushed during a period of change, as some people adjust to change more slowly than others  

When you or a change agent identify a program participant who is resisting change, schedule time to speak with them directly. Ask about their concerns, and ask what you can do to gain their support. Blount and Carroll recommend the following four ground rules for these conversations:

* **Forget efficiency:** Motivating change requires unhurried, face-to-face, one-on-one conversations.
* **Focus on listening:** Make everyone feel understood. Listen more than you speak and try to repeat back what you have heard as much as possible to reveal the root of resistance and develop a solution.
* **Be open to change yourself:** Have an open attitude and be ready to learn something new and, if necessary, modify the program plan.
* **Have multiple conversations:** In the first conversation, listen and diagnose the roots of the resistance. In the second conversation, your goal is to make clear that you have reflected on what you heard; to outline what will or will not be different in your approach to the change based on that conversation; and to explain why. Even if you do not change your overall plan, anyone who truly listens to opposition will have their thinking changed in some way.
