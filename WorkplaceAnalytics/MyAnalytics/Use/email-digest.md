# MyAnalytics digests

_**Applies to:** MyAnalytics elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [MyAnalytics plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q4-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

As a MyAnalytics user, you will receive a weekly digest that gives you key highlights about your previous week. This digest contains links that you can select to open your MyAnalytics dashboard.

The following is an example of a digest.
