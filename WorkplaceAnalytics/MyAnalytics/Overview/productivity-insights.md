# Productivity insights in Outlook

_(Powered by MyAnalytics)_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Do you ever wish to see reminders for 1:1 meetings with your manager, direct reports, or other top collaborators? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?  

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.  

## Insights that you might see

Open the Insights Outlook add-in by selecting the **Insights** icon on the Outlook **Home** ribbon. If you are using  Outlook on the web, open an email message, select the ellipsis (...) in the top-right corner of your email message, and then select **Insights**.
