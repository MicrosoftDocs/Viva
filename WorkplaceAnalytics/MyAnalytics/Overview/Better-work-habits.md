# Why use MyAnalytics?

> [!Note]
> Productivity insights that are powered by MyAnalytics are becoming broadly available for Office 365 users. [Learn more](../overview/plans-environments.md) about the experiences that users will get in each plan.

## Improve your work patterns through personal productivity insights

More people than ever feel they lack control over their time at work. Many teams spend 80-90% of their week sitting in meetings, sending emails, and talking on the phone. But 50% of meeting time is seen to be unproductive and almost half of employees report that their work interferes with their family life.

MyAnalytics is an extension of your Office 365 client experience that helps you find opportunities to build better habits and get back in control of your time. It uses everyday data from Microsoft Office 365 to give you insights into how you spend your time. It then provides insights and tips that help you work smarter.
