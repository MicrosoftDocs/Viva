# MyAnalytics data use protects privacy

MyAnalytics operates under the following privacy principles:

## You own the data in your inbox

When you look in your Office 365 mailbox, you see a record of interactions that you’ve had with other people. These interactions are of various kinds: emails that you’ve sent and received, meeting invitations, chats and calls in Teams or in Skype for Business. Because it’s your mailbox, you have a right to it and the information that it contains. In other words, your mailbox content is information that’s freely available to you.

Most of the interactions in your mailbox involve other people – for example, co-workers who’ve sent you emails or meeting invitations or received those things from you. These interactions provide you with a bit of information about how those co-workers used communication tools. If you want to know how many emails your manager sent you last month (eight, let’s say), you probably don’t ask her. Instead, you open your Outlook inbox, sort it by sender, and count.

The fact that those eight emails were sent by your manager doesn’t mean that this data about them (their count) belongs only to her. It also belongs to you, because you received them.

If you send an email to your IT person, you can assume he’ll know that you sent it, and when. Sending it means that you’ve chosen to reveal it (both its contents and its metadata) to him. If you do not want him to think you sent him email, the only thing you can do is _not send it in the first place_. (For the sake of argument, we’re ignoring the Outlook capability to recall a message.)

**Conclusion:** _What's in your inbox is yours. Your right to view the items in your mailbox supersedes someone else’s right to privacy over those items._

## No one but you sees your data

Let’s say you want to dig deeper into what’s in your inbox. For example, how many emails did you send to your co-workers in your off-work hours last week? How many did you send the week before, and the week before that?

You might want to uncover trends. Did you work more in your off hours before the winter break or after it? This sort of question is answered through analysis. That is where MyAnalytics comes in.

It looks in your inbox and in your calendar, crunches numbers, and gives insight into your behavior: How many emails did you send? How many meetings did you attend? How much time did you have to focus on your work? Rather than having to open your mailbox folders and count items, or open your calendar and add up meeting times, you can turn to MyAnalytics to see data of this sort.

The elements of MyAnalytics are personalized for you and available only to you. Only you can see your personal dashboard. The insights that appear in the Outlook add-in is for you only:

**Conclusion:** _Only you can see your MyAnalytics data. MyAnalytics insights are derived from data that was already available to you in your inbox._

## MyAnalytics doesn’t share any identifiable data with your coworkers

To calculate certain metrics like email read statistics, it’s necessary to aggregate data from multiple people in your organization. Although MyAnalytics is using mailbox data to calculate email read rates, it is de-identified. That is, any identifying information is removed. You, your manager, and other people at your company cannot tell any one person’s behavior from shown statistics. Although these aggregates are pieced together from data in people's mailbox, the shown results do not infringe on the privacy of any MyAnalytics user.  (For more information, see [Incremental data](privacy-guide.md#incremental-data).)

**Conclusion:** _MyAnalytics reports benchmarks that are calculated from historical mailbox data. It does this without divulging information about any individuals. This protects the privacy of all MyAnalytics participants._
