# Confirm the installation of the Insights Outlook add-in

The Insights Outlook add-in is automatically installed for your organization when you purchase one of the plans or add-ins listed in [Plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md). Users will start to see the Insights Outlook add-in in their Outlook application automatically after a license is assigned to them.

You can confirm that the Insights Outlook add-in is installed by looking in the "Services and add-ins" list for your organization in the Microsoft 365 Admin center.

2. Select the link to the [Microsoft 365 Admin center](https://aka.ms/admincenter).
