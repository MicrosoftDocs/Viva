# Get started with manager insights

As a people manager, confirm the following prerequisites. You can then sign in and see your team's data in Workplace Analytics.

## Prerequisites

* **Manager access** - Confirm that the Workplace Analytics admin has given you access to Workplace Analytics in [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md).
* **Licensed team** - You and your team are measured employees who are assigned a Workplace Analytics license and your team is included in the reporting hierarchy that leads to you as their manager. The hierarchy is based on the latest available HR data uploaded into Workplace Analytics by the admin.
* **Minimum team size** - Your team structure must meet the minimum group size of 10 or more measured and licensed employees.

## View your team's insights

After confirming the prerequisites, you can get a snapshot of how your team is currently doing in the following apps:

* [Microsoft Viva Insights app](teams-app.md)
* [Workplace Analytics app](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com)

Manager insights provides the following visibility into your team’s collaboration patterns, which are leading indicators that ladder up to overall wellbeing:

* **Employee experience** - Research shows that happy employees help boost productivity and reduce turnover. These insights and suggestions can help you maintain positive employee experiences, such as evaluating how much time your team is working after hours on email or instant messages, and if your team is getting enough 1:1 time with you and other managers.

* **Team effectiveness** - Nimble companies can more efficiently adapt to market changes and gain a true competitive advantage. The insights in this section show if your team has time to collaborate for rapid innovation, and to focus and produce higher quality work.

## Who is included

Insights are scoped to your team's data, including employees who you directly or indirectly manage within your defined organizational group. The date range shows you the most recent [Organizational data](../use/organizational-data.md) that's been uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, including the current date range and the number of *included employees* in your team. Your Workplace Analytics admin can give you more details about uploads and measured employees.

## About the insights

The following describes how your team metrics are calculated to support the behavioral insights for each of the business insight questions. With **Teams like yours**, you get comparable data from within your organization for context into broader organizational patterns. Today, "Team like yours" data is calculated as averages from peer manager teams. If you have only one peer team or no peer team, the company average is shown instead.

|Insight |Team metric description |Metric average for your team and "teams like yours" |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
|Coaching and development |One-on-one time is the number of meeting hours with only an employee and their manager.

|After-hours work |After-hours work is the number of hours employees spend in meetings and on email outside of working hours. This uses the working hours set in the employee's Outlook calendar settings. |Average number of total hours a team spent in meetings and on email outside of working hours. |
