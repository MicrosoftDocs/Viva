# Best practices for wellbeing

 More than 40 percent of creative ideas occur during breaks or when allowing your mind to wander. Employee burnout accounts for 20 to 50 percent of a company's annual employee turnover costs.

## Why it matters

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/) and [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can't](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/) articles, employees need to unplug:

* "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."
* "[87] percent of HR leaders cited improved retention as a critical or high priority over the next five years, but 20 percent said they had too many competing priorities to focus on fixing the problem this year."
* "According to the recent study of 1,400 workers, nearly half of respondents said that thinking about work outside of work hours regularly has a negative impact on their work-life balance."

## Best practices

* Use [MyAnalytics wellbeing data](../myanalytics/use/wellbeing.md) to learn about your after-hours work habits and to encourage you to recharge and disconnect.
* Utilize [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../MyAnalytics/Use/mya-notifications.md#delay-email-delivery) to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.
* Use [Teams Together mode](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/08/reimagining-virtual-collaboration-future-work-learning/) for a shared background on video meetings. It cuts down on video meeting fatigue by making them feel more like in-person.
* Alternate the time of global meetings to become more inclusive and minimize after-hours collaboration.
* Block time at the beginning and end of your day to simulate "commute time" to wrap days up and down.
* Take breaks during the day for meditation or brisk walks outside.
* Schedule meetings for 25 or 50 minutes instead of 30 or 60 minutes for transition time between meetings.

## Change strategies

### Start a wellbeing plan

Enroll your team in a [Workplace Analytics wellbeing teamwork plan](../tutorials/teamwork-solution.md). Plan participants will receive a weekly digest, in-line suggestions, and actionable insights.

#### Define and share working hours

Add your working hours to your [Outlook email signature](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-an-email-signature-from-a-template-5b02c5ed-1e85-4d2a-a098-9628fe3231d8) and encourage your team to do the same to help manage the expectations of others. The following is an email signature example:

```
Cora Thomas
Program Manager
Redmond, Washington
My working hours are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM PT
```

#### Delay delivery of after-hours email

Utilize [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../MyAnalytics/Use/mya-notifications.md#delay-email-delivery) to delay email delivery to your team when you send emails after hours or over the weekend.

#### Create norm of scheduling focus time

People often feel overloaded because tasks take more time than expected. Focus time is a block of time without meetings to get work done or decompress at the end of the day. Ways to support it:

* Send team communications about the importance of focus time.
* Use a [MyAnalytics Focus plan](../myanalytics/use/focus-plan.md) to schedule focus time in your calendar, and then decline meetings and ignore email during that time.
* Share anecdotes around when people have successes by utilizing their focus time.
