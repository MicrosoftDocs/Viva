# Increase customer focus

Companies that prioritize customer relationships and satisfaction grow revenue faster than competitors. Research shows that companies that prioritize customer relationships and satisfaction grow revenue 2.5 times faster than their competitors.

Each of the behaviors listed show how your organization compares with others based on industry research and your specific organizational data.

## Calculations

The following are the percentage insights, their underlying metrics, and a little about the calculations used for them.

![Increase customer focus percentage insight example](../images/wpa/use/customer-focus-percent.png)

|Behavior |Percentage insight | Metrics |Calculations |
|---------|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
|Optimize time with customers  |Percentage of employees who spend 8+ hours in external collaboration every week |[External network size and external collaboration hours](metric-definitions.md#person-metrics) and [connected people and connected groups](glossary.md) |Percentage of employees who spend more than 8 hours collaborating with people outside the company. This insight is calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period. |
|Promote coaching and development |Percentage of employees who have less than 15 minutes of 1:1 time with their managers each week |[Meeting hours with manager 1:1](metric-definitions.md#meeting-hours-with-manager-1-1-define) |The percentage of employees who spend less than 15 minutes of coaching time with their managers each week. To account for different frequencies in coaching, this percentage is calculated monthly and then divided by four to get a weekly average. |
<!--|Strengthen internal networks |Percentage of employees who have fewer than five relationships with internal organizations |[Influence metric](metric-definitions.md#organizational-network-analysis-ona-metrics) |Calculates how much time employees spent collaborating with the internal network per month and averaged over the entire time period. |-->

The following defines the organizational data shown in the visual behavioral insights.

|Behavior |Visual insight |Definition |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
|Optimize time with customers |Distribution of external collaboration |Percentage of employees grouped by their weekly [external collaboration hours](metric-definitions.md#person-metrics). They are divided into groups of employees who spend zero to four0-4 hours, 4-8four to eight hours, and more than eight8+ hours collaborating externally with people outside the company. These percentages are calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period. |
|Promote coaching and development |Distribution of monthly 1:1 time with managers |Percentage of employees based on their monthly [meeting hours with manager 1:1](metric-definitions.md#meeting-hours-with-manager-1-1-define). They are divided into employees who have no 1:1s, have between zero and one hour, and have more than one hour of 1:1s with their manager in a month. These percentages are calculated monthly and averaged over the entire time period. |
<!--|Strengthen internal networks |Internal network connections by employee network strength |An [organizational network graph](insight-ona-measures.md) represents the distribution of current managers and potential managers as compared with the other employees within your organization, based on influence scores. You can use this insight to evaluate future managers with high influence scores who are currently not in managerial roles. This graph uses the [influence metric](metric-definitions.md#organizational-network-analysis-ona-metrics). |-->

## Best practices

This section describes why each of the following behaviors matter and the top best practices that can help increase customer focus.

* [Optimize time with customers](#optimize-time-with-customers)
* [Promote coaching and development](#promote-coaching-and-development)
<!--* [Strengthen internal networks](#strengthen-internal-networks)-->

### Optimize time with customers

Collaboration with customers and other external contacts enables employees to gain the customer and market knowledge needed for business success. Spending time collaborating with customers helps you better anticipate customer's needs and develop products and services that create real value.

According to [Optimizing sales and connecting with customers in the age of big data and machine learning](https://insights.office.com/sales-excellence/optimizing-sales-workplace-analytics/): "More time spent with customers; larger internal networks; and more time spent with managers and senior leadership. These three behaviors persisted regardless of region, territory, or sales role, suggesting that they are foundational ingredients for success.” Ways to support customer focus:

* Use [MyAnalytics Important people list](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#add-important-people) for key external contacts, which enables immediate notification of email from them, more efficient responses to their requests, and reminders to schedule time to connect with them.
* Create a shared [Teams channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) with key customers for direct, informal chats and prompt responses to urgent requests.

For best practices and how to track time with your most important external contacts, see [Best practices for customer collaboration](../tutorials/gm-cust-collab.md).

### Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition. According to [How to make your one-on-ones with employees more productive](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/how-to-make-your-one-on-ones-with-employees-more-productive/): "One-on-ones are one of the most important productivity tools you have as a manager." Ways to keep employees engaged:

* Use [Insights](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#catch-up-with-your-team) to schedule 1:1 time, receive reminders to do so, and follow up on tasks related to direct reports.
* Require managers to schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with their direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal.

For more best practices and how to develop a 1:1 conversation series, see [Best practices for manager coaching](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

<!--### Strengthen internal networks

Employees who maintain strong internal networks are better resourced to meet customer needs and achieve goals. Connecting employees across units creates agile innovation by helping the company leverage benefits of scale, cross-pollinate ideas, and integrate different perspectives.

The [How to Make Sure Agile Teams Can Work Together](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-make-sure-agile-teams-can-work-together/) article says “Work occurs through collaboration in networks of relationships that often do not mirror formal reporting structures or standard work processes."

Ways to foster cross-group collaboration:

* Improve internal connectivity. Create inclusive and trusting environments to facilitate agile collaboration. Employees who maintain large, stable, and diversified internal networks are often better positioned to leverage their connections for quickly responding to customer needs and driving customer satisfaction.
* Create cross-functional [Teams channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) that focus on customer needs.
* Use [MyAnalytics to manage important people](../myanalytics/use/network.md) to mark key internal contacts as important to never miss emails from them and to respond more efficiently.

For more best practices and how to provide managers with go-to contacts list, see [Best practices for cross-group collaboration](../tutorials/gm-cgcollaboration.md).
