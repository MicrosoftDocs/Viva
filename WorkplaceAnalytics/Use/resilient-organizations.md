|Behavior |Visual insight | Definition |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
|Protect employee wellbeing | Distribution of after-hours collaboration  |Percentage of employees based on their weekly [after-hours collaboration](metric-definitions.md#person-metrics).

They are divided into employees who have no 1:1s, between zero and one hour, and more than one hour of 1:1s with their manager in a month. These percentages are calculated monthly and averaged over the entire time period. |
|Free up capacity | Distribution of collaboration hours |Percentage of employees based on their weekly [collaboration hours](metric-definitions.md#collaboration-hours-define). They are divided into those who spend between 0 and 10 hours, 10 and 20 hours, and more than 20 hours collaborating.

|Accelerate decision-making| Distribution of conflicting meeting hours |Percentage of employees based on their [conflicting meeting hours](metric-definitions.md#conflicting-meeting-hours-define).

## Best practices to enhance organizational resiliency

<!--### Improve team cohesion

Changes in work environments can leave employees feeling isolated from their colleagues. Feeling part of community is important for engagement and goal alignment as employees navigate change.

According to the [Horizontal collaboration and cross-silo leadership](https://insights.office.com/networks/cross-silo-leadership-horizontal-collaboration/) article, it's important to develop and deploy cultural "brokers" to "promote cross-boundary work in one of two ways: by acting as a bridge or as an adhesive."

Ways to improve team cohesion:

* In MyAnalytics, add colleagues to your [important people list](../myanalytics/use/use-the-insights.md#add-important-people); also, receive suggestions to meet and reminders to respond to emails and complete tasks from these contacts.
* Provide teams with virtual opportunities to bond over non-work activities and form new connections. Create agendas with fun conversation prompts and activities such as online games.

For more best practices, see [Best practices for manager connectedness](../tutorials/gm-connectedness.md).

### Protect employee wellbeing

Rapid shifts in ways of working can blur the line between 'home' and 'work'. One indicator of burnout risk is the amount of time employees spend collaborating outside of standard business hours.

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/): "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."

Ways to protect employee wellbeing:

* Use [MyAnalytics wellbeing](../myanalytics/use/wellbeing.md) to learn about your after-hours work habits and to encourage you to disconnect and recharge.
* Utilize [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../MyAnalytics/Use/mya-notifications.md#delay-email-delivery) to automatically delay email delivery to align with configured working hours of coworkers.
* Use [Teams Together mode](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/08/reimagining-virtual-collaboration-future-work-learning/) for a shared background on video meetings. It cuts down on video meeting fatigue by making them feel more like in-person.

### Practice empathy

During periods of disruption, managers play a critical role in helping employees navigate change and preserve a sense of belonging. Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition.

According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/): "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."

Ways to improve coaching:

* Use [MyAnalytics](../myanalytics/overview/privacy-guide.md#assistance-for-people-managers) to automatically schedule 1:1 time, receive reminders to do so, and follow up on tasks related to direct reports.
* Require managers to meet with direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal.

For more best practices and ways to establish better manager-team connections, see [Best practices for manager coaching](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

### Free up capacity

Resilient organizations respond to changing demands and new opportunities by nimbly adapting and refocusing employees' time to align with new priorities.

The [Stop the meeting madness](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/out-of-control-meetings-waste-time-undermine-work/) article explains what 182 senior managers in a range of industries said about meetings when surveyed, including "65 percent said meetings keep them from completing their own work" and "71 percent said meetings are unproductive and inefficient."

Ways to free up capacity:

* Channels in Microsoft Teams provide team members with a new way to get questions answered and provide updates without the need for a meeting.
* Encourage employees to politely say no to meetings that lack an agenda or are misaligned with priorities. The feedback will motivate organizers to plan more carefully.

For more best practices and ways to establish 'meeting-free' periods, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).

### Accelerate decision-making

Rapidly changing conditions require swift decision-making. Managers with poor calendar management habits become obstacles to team goal attainment and create bottlenecks in decision-making.

According to [Five ways to empower your team to make decisions](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/five-ways-to-empower-your-team-to-make-decisions/): “Employee empowerment is directly tied to results. A study by Zenger Folkman found 4 percent of employees are willing to put in more effort when empowerment is low, while 67 percent are willing to go above and beyond when empowerment is high.”

Ways to empower decision-making:

* Provide wide access to Teams meeting recordings and OneNote notes in public channels whenever possible to increase the rate of information sharing. Also, provide wide access to meeting notes using Teams and OneNote.
* Use Team channels to share information as it emerges both formally through notes and files and informally through chats.
* MyAnalytics insights helps improve calendar management by increasing awareness of conflicting meetings and suggesting meetings to stay informed of decisions.
* Managers who decline meetings as soon as possible with a brief explanation for why they did so reinforce decision rights and model healthy habits.
