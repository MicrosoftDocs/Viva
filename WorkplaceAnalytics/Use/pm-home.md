# Workplace Analytics manager insights

> [!Note]
> Only people managers granted access to Workplace Analytics in [Manager settings](../use/settings.md#manager-settings) can see their team's data in Workplace Analytics.

As a people manager, you can get actionable insights about your team based on industry expert research. You can see how your team is currently getting work done and get suggestions on maintaining employee engagement, improving team collaboration, and increasing organizational agility.

Use the following available information to lead your team toward more effective business outcomes:

* **Employee experience** - Research shows that happy employees help boost productivity and reduce turnover. These insights and suggestions can help you maintain positive employee experiences, such as evaluating how much time your team is working after hours on email or instant messages, and if your team is getting enough 1:1 time with you and other managers.

* **Team effectiveness** - Nimble companies can more efficiently adapt to market changes and gain a true competitive advantage. The insights in this section show if your team has time to collaborate for rapid innovation, and to focus and produce higher quality work.

* **My team's data** - Insights are scoped to your team's data, including employees who you directly or indirectly manage within your defined organizational group. The date range shows you the most recent [Organizational data](organizational-data.md) that's been uploaded to and processed in Workplace Analytics, including the current date range and the number of *measured employees* in your team. Your Workplace Analytics admin can give you more details about uploads and measured employees.
