### Alert card

On the Home page, the card in the upper left alerts you in various ways. It changes its appearance and message depending on the time of day and the events in your Outlook calendar. For example, if your lunchtime (as [configured in MyAnalytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/myanalytics/use/use-the-insights#set-lunch-hours)) is approaching, it lets you know how soon:

The card's color changes to alert you of other events, such as scheduled focus time, meetings, and even the switch from morning to afternoon and the approach of the end of your scheduled workday or [Virtual commute]():

### Take a break

This feature offers a one-minute "breathing break" animated experience that you can use as often as you want during your workday. To start it, select **Start**. 

### Microsoft To-Do

This card shows tasks that are in your **To-Do** list that are due today or for which a reminder for today has been set. Select **All To-Do tasks for today** to open the Tasks app in Teams. For more information, see [Microsoft To-Do](https://todosupport.helpshift.com/a/microsoft-to-do/?p=web).
