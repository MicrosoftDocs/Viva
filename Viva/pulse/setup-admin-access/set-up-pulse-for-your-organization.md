# Set up Viva Pulse for your organization

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Private Preview program to access it. Features are subject to change.

To set up Viva Pulse from the Microsoft Admin Center, the user must have the Global Microsoft 365 administrator role. The following settings can be managed from the Microsoft Admin Center for Viva Pulse.

**Assign Viva Pulse Admin:** The Global admin can select users to reassign them to a different role or remove them from a role.

**Install the Viva Pulse app for your organization:** Your Microsoft Teams admin can choose to deploy and pin the app for all users or for specific departments through a [Teams app setup policy](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

To install apps using an app setup policy, follow these steps:

1. Sign into the Teams admin center and access **Teams apps** and select [Setup policies](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-setup).
2. Select **Add**.
3. Enter a name and description for the policy.
4. Under **Installed apps**, select **Add apps**.
5. In the **Add installed apps** pane, search for the apps that youâ€™d like to install for users. You can also filter apps by app permission policy.
6. Select **Add**.

For more information, see [Learn more about installing apps in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#install-apps).

**Pin Viva Pulse in Teams:** We highly recommend that you pin this app by default for users. Use Teams app to set up policies to pin this app by default in the left display of the Teams app and apply this policy to a batch of users.

Create an app setup policy to pin apps. To create an app setup policy to pin apps, follow these steps:

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** and select [Setup policies](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-setup).
2. Select **Add**.
3. Enter a name and description for the policy.
4. Optionally, turn on **User pinning** to allow users to pin apps and change the order of the pinned apps to personalize their app bar.
5. Under **Pinned apps**, select **Add apps**.
6. In the **Add pinned apps** pane, search for the apps you want to add, and then select Add. You can also filter apps by app permission policy.
7. Select **Add**.
8. Arrange the apps in the order that you want them to appear in Teams.
9. Select **Save**.

For more information, see [Manage apps setup policies in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#install-apps).
