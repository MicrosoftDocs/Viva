# Enable notifications for your organization

Viva Pulse uses the Teams Activity feed, Teams Chat, and email to deliver notifications. Users receive Teams and email notifications when a feedback author requests a Pulse, when feedback providers are reminded to respond, when a feedback author is notified their Pulse request closed, and when a feedback author shares a Pulse report.

## Teams notifications

Users only receive Teams Activity feed and Teams Chat notifications from Viva Pulse if they have the Viva Pulse Teams app installed. As an admin, you can install the Viva Pulse Teams app in your tenant through a [Teams app setup policy](./manage-install-pin-viva-pulse-in-teams-admin-center.md). If users are not receiving Teams Activity feed and Teams Chat notifications from Viva Pulse, users should visit the Teams app store to install the Viva Pulse Teams app.

### Teams Chat notifications

If users in your tenant already have the Viva Pulse Teams app installed and are not receiving Teams Chat notifications, their Viva Pulse Teams app has not been upgraded to the latest version that includes the Teams Chat notifications. As an admin, you can create a [Teams app setup policy](./manage-install-pin-viva-pulse-in-teams-admin-center.md) to push the Viva Pulse Teams app update for users in your tenant.

If users are on **old Microsoft Teams** and are not receiving Teams Chat notifications, they should open the Viva Pulse Teams app and select **Update** in the banner at the top of the app to upgrade to the latest app version. If users are on **new Microsoft Teams** and are not receiving Teams Chat notifications, they should select **Apps** on the left side of Teams, **Manage your apps** at the bottom left of the screen, and **Update** next to Viva Pulse to upgrade to the latest app version. For more information, see [Update an app in new Microsoft Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/update-an-app-in-microsoft-teams-3d53d136-5c5d-4dfa-9602-01e6fdd8015b).

## Email notifications

Users receive email notifications from Viva Pulse. It can take up to 24 hours for email notifications to be delivered to Pulse feedback providers and authors. If email notifications are not delivered within 24 hours, log a support incident or report the issue through our in-app feedback options.
