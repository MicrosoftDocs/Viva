# Enable notifications for your organization  

Viva Pulse leverages email to deliver notifications. As an admin, you need to execute a script in PowerShell for these notifications to appear. After the script is executed successfully, users will receive email notifications when a feedback author requests a Pulse, when feedback providers are reminded to respond, when a feedback author is notified their Pulse request has closed, and when a feedback author shares a Pulse report. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It may take up to 24 hours for all email notifications to be delivered to Pulse feedback providers and authors. If email notifications are not being delivered within 24 hours, please log a support incident or report the issue through our in-app feedback options.

Enable email notifications for your tenant and ensure you have [PowerShell installed](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows):

## Using Azure AD PowerShell

1. Connect to the target tenant in Azure AD PowerShell\
`Connect-AzureAD -TenantId "[TENANT-ID]"`\
When prompted, login as the **Tenant Admin / Global Admin** for the tenant.
2. Create the service principle\
`New-AzureADServicePrincipal-AppId "56233257-15ee-4d3d-bdcd-9aa975244e4c" -DisplayName "[Viva Pulse]"`
3. Validate that the service principle is created\
`Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId <objectID>`\
*where objectId = what you get back after running step (2)*\
OR\
`Get-AzureADServicePrincipal`\
And find Viva Pulse in the list returned

## Using Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK

1. Connect to the target tenant in Azure AD PowerShell\
`Connect-MgGraph -TenantId "[TENANT-ID]" -Scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All"`\
When prompted, login as the **Tenant Admin / Global Admin** for the tenant.
2. Create the service principle\
`$sp = New-MgServicePrincipal -AppId "56233257-15ee-4d3d-bdcd-9aa975244e4c" -DisplayName "[Viva Pulse]"`
3. Validate that the service principle is created\
`Get-MgServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalId $sp.Id`\
OR\
`Get-MgServicePrincipal`\
And find Viva Pulse in the list returned

Note that if email notifications are not enabled by running this script, feedback authors may not receive enough responses to their Pulses to review their teamâ€™s feedback and notifications increase the likelihood that more responses are generated. Alternatively, feedback authors can copy links to their Pulse requests and generated reports and share them directly through a personal email or Teams message.
