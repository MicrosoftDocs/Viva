# Manage, install, and pin Viva Pulse in the Teams admin center

The following settings are optional and are not required to be completed before users in the organization can start using Viva Pulse. You must be a Teams Admin for the following tasks.

## Control access to Viva Pulse

To allow access to Viva Pulse or to block specific users from using Viva Pulse, you can create a custom app permission policy. You can only control access to Viva Pulse for the Teams experience. You cannot control access for the web experience.

For more information, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies).

## Install the Viva Pulse app using an app setup policy

You can choose to deploy and pin the Viva Pulse app for all users or for specific departments through a [Teams app setup policy](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

To install apps using an app setup policy, follow these steps:

1. Sign into the Teams admin center, access **Teams apps**, and select [Setup policies](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/app-setup).
2. Select **Add**.
3. Enter a name and description for the policy.
4. Under **Installed apps**, select **Add apps**.
5. In the **Add installed apps** pane, search for the apps that youâ€™d like to install for users. You can also filter apps by app permission policy.
6. Select **Add**.

For more information, see [Learn more about installing apps in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#install-apps).
