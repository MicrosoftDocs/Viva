# Prerequisites and admin roles

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Microsoft Teams deployed for your organization to use Viva Pulse in Microsoft Teams. Viva Pulse will also be available as a web experience for which users will not need a Microsoft Teams application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Pulse requires its users to be assigned Microsoft Forms licenses to send a Pulse. A user will not need a Microsoft Forms license to respond to a Pulse. If there are any tenant-wide conditional policies set up for Microsoft Forms that require users to accept terms of use, those policies will be bypassed for a seamless experience.

## Admin roles and permissions

Viva Pulse admins must have a license to one of the following: Viva Pulse Standalone, Viva Insights Bundle, Viva Suite, or the Viva Pulse Admin-led trial. For more information, see [Licensing requirements](../get-started/licensing-requirements.md). The following roles and permissions are required to set up Viva Pulse.

| Roles | Permissions |

| Microsoft 365 Global Admin | The Microsoft 365 Global Admin has global access to most management features and data across Microsoft online services. For Viva Pulse, the Microsoft 365 Global Admin can install and pin the Viva Pulse app in Microsoft Teams, assign a user to the Viva Pulse Admin role, and manage in-app Viva Pulse settings as well. |
