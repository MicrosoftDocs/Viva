# Prerequisites and admin roles

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Microsoft Teams deployed for your organization to use Viva Pulse in Microsoft Teams. Viva Pulse will also be available as a web experience for which users will not need a Microsoft Teams application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Pulse requires its users to be assigned Microsoft Forms licenses to send a Pulse. A user will not need a Microsoft Forms license to respond to a Pulse. If there are any tenant-wide conditional policies set up for Microsoft Forms that require users to accept terms of use, those policies will be bypassed for a seamless experience.

## Admin roles and permissions

Viva Pulse admins must have a license to one of the following: Viva Pulse Standalone, Viva Insights Bundle, Viva Suite, or the Viva Pulse Admin-led trial. For more information, see [Licensing requirements](../get-started/licensing-requirements.md). The following roles and permissions are required to set up Viva Pulse.

| Roles | Permissions |
