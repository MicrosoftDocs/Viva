# Set up the in-app Viva Pulse experience

The Viva Pulse in-app experience can be managed by users with the Viva Pulse admin role. If you're the Viva Pulse admin, you see a Manage tab next to the Home tab in the Viva Pulse header. You can manage all settings for the in-app Viva Pulse experience in the Manage tab. <br>

## Privacy and confidentiality

As an admin, you can set privacy and confidentiality options for your organization. This includes setting the minimum number of responses required to see feedback, adding a custom privacy policy statement, and choosing to turn off the collection of user diagnostic data.

### Minimum response required to see the feedback default value

All Pulses require a minimum number of responses before authors can view unattributed feedback. Lowering this number may compromise the confidentiality of feedback providers. Changing the default won't affect any currently deployed pulses. The minimum value allowed is 3 and maximum value allowed is 25. To set the minimum response required to see the feedback default value:

1. In the **Manage** tab, go to the **Privacy** tab.
2. Under the **Minimum number of responses required to see feedback** section,  you can select a value between 3 and 25 using either the carrot or typing in the value.
3. The value is autosaved.

### Customized privacy policy link

You can add your company’s privacy policy to be shown in the app in place of the Microsoft privacy statement. This change is reflected in the common navigation header (top right ellipses). When the user clicks on **Privacy**, they're taken to your company’s privacy policy. To customize the privacy statement:

1. In the **Manage** tab, go to the **Privacy** tab.
2. Under the **Customize privacy policy statement** section, in the text box labeled **Link to privacy policy statement**, type or paste a link to your company’s privacy statement to be shown in the app in place of the Microsoft privacy statement.
3. The value is autosaved.

### Diagnostic data

There are two types of data that we collect: Required Diagnostic Data (RDD) and Optional Diagnostic Data (ODD). By default, ODD and RDD are enabled. As an admin, you can go into the Admin Center in the Viva Pulse app and de-enable the collection of diagnostic data. Once collection of diagnostic data has been de-enabled, previously collected data for the tenant is still available, but additional data is no longer collected.

* Required Diagnostic Data: Telemetry collected to help us make product improvements and provide enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.
* Optional Diagnostic Data: Telemetry gathered to ensure the customers are secure, up to date, and performing as expected.

To turn off Required Diagnostic Data or Optional Diagnostic Data collection:

1. From the **Manage** tab, go to the **Privacy** tab.
2. Navigate to the **Required diagnostic data** and **Optional diagnostic data** section.
3. To turn off data collection for either Required Diagnostic Data or Optional Diagnostic Data, use the toggles associated with **Required Diagnostic Data** or **Optional Diagnostic Data**.
4. The update is autosaved.

## Customization

### Customize Pulses

Customization is turned on by default, but as an admin, you can control whether feedback authors can add their own questions to existing stock templates or edit existing stock questions through granular access controls. To make any customization configurations, see [Granular access controls](./granular-access-controls.md).

### Customize your organization’s policy statement

As an admin, you can also set customization options for your organization. This includes an option to add a link to internal guidance and policies governing appropriate survey questions, which will be shown to users during survey creation.

You can use this link to remind employees of internal policies and guidelines for writing survey questions within your organization. When the feedback author clicks on the link while customizing a survey, they are taken to your company’s internal policy.

1. In the **Manage** tab, go to the **Customization** tab.
2. Under the **Customized organizational policy statement** section, in the text box labeled **Link to organization’s policy statement**, type or paste a link to your company’s internal policy statement to be shown in the customization flow in place of the Microsoft policy statement.
3. The value is autosaved.

## Notifications

An employee’s ability to manage their email notifications preferences is default turned on, but as an admin, you can control whether the employee can manage their email notification preferences. Once the default is turned off, employees can't manage their email notification preferences and will receive all of Viva Pulse’s email notifications. To make any notification configurations:

1. In the **Manage** tab, navigate to the **Notifications** tab.
2. To turn on or turn off email notification preferences, use the toggle associated with **Allow users to opt out of emails**.
3. The update is autosaved.

## Viva resources

Viva Pulse reports show recommended learning content for users to learn more about specific Pulse topics. These learning resources are sourced from LinkedIn Learning and can be viewed in the Viva Learning app. If your users are not subscribed to LinkedIn Learning or do not use Viva Learning, they will not be able to access those resources, even though the resources are shown. For example, a learning video might be displayed, but it will not play for those users. In this case, you may want to disable the display of these learning resources. To make any learning resource configurations:

1. In the **Manage** tab, navigate to the **Viva Resources** tab.
2. To turn on or turn off Viva Learning videos, use the toggle associated with **Viva Learning**.
3. The update is autosaved.

## Delete user data

As an admin, you can delete a user’s past Pulse requests and responses on the user’s behalf. Deletion of a user’s data is a hard deletion, and no record of the user’s data remains. You can only delete one user’s data at a time, and there's no limit as to how many times a user’s data can be deleted. To delete a user’s data:

1. In the **Manage** tab, navigate to the **Delete user data** tab.
2. Search for the user that requested their data be deleted by using the search bar and select that user in the populated options.
3. Select **Delete user data**.
4. Select **Delete user data** again in the confirmation box.
5. You see a status message in the deletion log that says **‘Pending’**. Deletions can take up to a few minutes.
6. Once the deletion is successful, the status of the deletion changes to **‘Deleted’**.
7. If the deletion was unsuccessful, then the status of the deletion changes to **‘Not Deleted’**. In this instance, please try the deletion again.
