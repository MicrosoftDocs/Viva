# Granular access controls for Viva Pulse

As an admin, you can use access policies to manage which users can access specific features in Viva Pulse. Feature access management gives you the ability to enable or disable specific features in Viva Pulse for particular groups or users in your tenant and tailor Viva Pulse to meet your local regulatory and business requirements. See [Control access to features in Viva](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2245618) to learn more.

## Customization

You can control whether feedback authors can add their own questions to existing stock templates or edit existing stock questions through centralized feature access management, which allows you to configure access to customization capabilities at the tenant level, group level (using AAD groups or M365 groups), or at the user level for maximum flexibility. The customization control will be default turned on for your tenant.

To make customization configurations, you need to use a PowerShell cmdlet:

1. Use the **Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet** to create a new access policy to disable customization in Viva Pulse. See [Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet](/powershell/module/exchange/add-vivamodulefeaturepolicy) for detailed documentation.
2. Use the **Update-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet** to update your access policy for customization in Viva Pulse. See [Update-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet](/powershell/module/exchange/update-vivamodulefeaturepolicy) for detailed documentation.
3. Use the **Get-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet** to view your access policies for customization in Viva Pulse. See [Get-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet](/powershell/module/exchange/get-vivamodulefeaturepolicy) for detailed documentation.
4. Use the **Remove-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet** to delete an access policy for customization in Viva Pulse. See [Remove-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy cmdlet](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-vivamodulefeaturepolicy) for detailed documentation.
