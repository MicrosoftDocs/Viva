# View & share feedback results as a feedback author

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Private Preview program to access it. Features are subject to change.

Feedback authors can view the feedback results from their team if they obtained the minimum number of responses needed to meet the confidentiality threshold.

## View feedback results as feedback author in Viva Pulse

1. Two methods exist to view the feedback report.
    - Select the **Teams Activity Feed notification** that your feedback request closed.
    - Select the corresponding **feedback request card** from the Viva Pulse homepage **My pulses** section, under the **Pulses sent** tab.
1. The report summary page will have the following sections/actions:
    - View how many users responded to the Pulse request, both as a percentage and a count.
    - Select **View all** under **Who you invited** to view the list of feedback providers for the Pulse request.
    - Select **Resend pulse** to resend the Pulse request.
1. If you did not obtain the minimum number of responses to meet the confidentiality threshold, you cannot view scores or responses for any question. You can still view the number of feedback providers invited and resend the Pulse request.
1. If you obtained the minimum number of responses to meet the confidentiality threshold, you will have the following sections/actions:
    - View the average score for each rating question, along with the trend change from the last time the Pulse request was sent.
    - View top suggestions for each multiple-choice question.
    - View the number of responses received for each open-ended question and select the comments link to open a dialog containing all the open-ended responses. This applies to both multiple-choice and open-ended questions.
1. Choose to share the Pulse requests with other users in your organization by selecting the **Share results** button at the top or bottom of the report summary page.
1. Facilitate a conversation with your team about the feedback results by selecting the **Discuss** option in the **Review discussion guide** section at the bottom of the report summary page.
1. For any rating question that has a follow-up multiple-choice question, select the question row and dive into a detailed page for that question:
    1. View how the score for the question has been trending over time by hovering over a specific point in the trend graph. Note that to view trends for a question, the feedback author **must resend the same Pulse request**. If the feedback author chooses to send a new Pulse request from the Viva Pulse homepage instead of resending the same Pulse request, the score trend view will not be generated.
    1. View the favorability scores for the question.
        - Responses with a score of 4 or 5 are positive.
        - Responses with a score of 3 are neutral.
        - Responses with a score of 1 or 2 are negative.
    1. View the corresponding multiple-choice responses for each follow-up question by seeing which options were most selected by feedback providers, shown in decreasing order of popularity.
    1. View any open-ended responses that may have been provided as part of the follow-up multiple-choice question.
    1. View any recommended learning content for the selected question. The learning course will open in Viva Learning when selected. Note that recommended Viva Learning links will only show for reports generated after March 21, 2023.
