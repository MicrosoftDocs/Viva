# Licensing requirements

To send a pulse, you must have a license to one of the following:

1. **Viva Suite**: Users with a Viva Suite subscription license have access to all applications that are part of the Viva Suite, including Viva Pulse. To learn more about the Viva apps within the Viva Suite, visit [Employee experience and engagement in Microsoft Viva](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva).
2. **Viva Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback**: Users with a Viva Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback subscription license have access to Viva Pulse, Viva Insights, and Viva Glint. To learn more about Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback, visit [Workplace Analytics and Employee Feedback](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/workplace-analytics-and-feedback).
3. **Viva Pulse Admin-led Trial**: The Viva Pulse Admin-led Trial allows Billing Admins to assign 25 users within their tenant to try Viva Pulse for 30 days. During the 30 days, users can use the full functionality of Viva Pulse. Please contact your field seller or account executive to set up your own trial.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Additionally, a user must have an active license to Microsoft Forms to create and send a Pulse request. A user does not need a license to respond to a Pulse request.

## Assign licenses

To enable users to start using Viva Pulse, Global IT Admins must assign licenses to the members of the relevant organizations or departments. Only users with a valid license can create and send Pulse requests.

To assign licenses to users:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Users** and then **Active users**.
2. Select the users or user group that you want to assign licenses to and select **Licenses and apps**.
3. Under **Licenses**, select **Viva Pulse**.

For more information on assigning licenses, see [assigning Microsoft 365 licenses to users](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/assign-licenses-to-users).
