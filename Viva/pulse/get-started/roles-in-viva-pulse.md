# Roles in Microsoft Viva Pulse

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Private Preview program to access it. Features are subject to change.

When you use Viva Pulse in your Microsoft 365 environment, your users can have one or more of the following roles:  
* [Feedback author](#feedback-author)
* [Feedback provider](#feedback-provider)
* [Viva Pulse Admin](#viva-pulse-admin)

## Feedback author

Feedback authors are users in your organization who will be sending Pulse requests to their direct reports, team members, or other users in the organization. Authors will see the option to request feedback from the available research-backed templates. If customization is enabled for your organization, then authors can add their own questions to the end of any of the templates to personalize the Pulse to their teamâ€™s needs. Authors can view the feedback results of their Pulse request   once it closes and meets the confidentiality threshold with the minimum number of responses required. The feedback author can also share the report with other users to facilitate team conversations.

To send a Pulse request, a user must be assigned a Viva Pulse or a Viva Suite license seat by their Microsoft 365 administrator.

## Feedback provider

Feedback providers are the users in an organization who receive a Pulse request. Pulse requests can be received by users if they are part of the same Azure Active Directory tenant of the organization. They have the critical role of responding to Pulse requests and providing the feedback needed to power the aggregate reporting and insights for the feedback author.

## Viva Pulse Admin

Users with the Viva Pulse Admin role can configure the Viva Pulse experience for their end users at the tenant level through the in-app admin experience. This role is assigned to users from the Microsoft Admin Center. For more information, see [Set up the in-app Viva Pulse experience](../setup-admin-access/set-up-in-app-pulse-experience.md).
