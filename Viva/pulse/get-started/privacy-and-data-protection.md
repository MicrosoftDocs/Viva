# Privacy and data protection

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Private Preview program to access it. Features are subject to change.

## Protections for responders

Due to the potential sensitivity about how the individual employee’s feedback could be used, a minimum threshold of responses is required for the manager or team lead to be able to review the team’s feedback results after the feedback collection period ends. Pulse admins can increase or decrease the threshold if desired.

Additionally, Viva Pulse leverages research-backed surveys developed by people scientists with a focus on maximizing the effectiveness of the responses and    protecting the confidentiality of the feedback providers. Results are only displayed to the feedback author in aggregate after the Pulse has closed.

## Protections for people managers and team leads

Viva Pulse provides people managers and team leads control over the shared reports. By default, only the author who sent the Pulse can see the aggregated results, with a “share” option available if desired. If results are shared, only the aggregate information is viewable by those with whom the results are shared. Any free-text comments are hidden from the shared report to protect both the authors and the respondents.
