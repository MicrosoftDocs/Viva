# Privacy and data protection

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Public Preview program to access it. See [Set up Viva Pulse Public Preview](../setup-admin-access/set-up-viva-pulse-public-preview-for-your-organization.md) to enable the Viva Pulse Public Preview for your organization and enable Teams Activity feed notifications for users in your tenant. Also, please note that customer support will only be available in English for Public Preview. Features are subject to change. As a reminder, all tenant and user data from Public Preview will be deleted on July 14, 2023.

## Protections for responders

Due to the potential sensitivity about how the individual employee’s feedback could be used, a minimum threshold of responses is required for the manager or team lead to be able to review the team’s feedback results after the feedback collection period ends. Pulse admins can increase or decrease the threshold.

Additionally, Viva Pulse leverages research-backed surveys developed by people scientists with a focus on maximizing the effectiveness of the responses and protecting the confidentiality of the feedback providers. Results are only displayed to the feedback author in aggregate after the Pulse has closed.

## Protections for people managers and team leads

Viva Pulse provides people managers and team leads control over shared reports. By default, only the author who sent the Pulse can see the aggregated results, but they have the ability to share. If results are shared, only the aggregate information is viewable by those with whom the results are shared. Free-text comments are hidden from the shared report to protect both the authors and the responders.
