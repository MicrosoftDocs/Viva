# Start a trial with Viva Pulse

This article describes how to set up and run an IT admin-led trial to deploy Viva Pulse to your organization.

## IT Admin-led trials

IT admin trials offer 25 users in your organization access to Viva Pulse for 30 days. If you would like to provide access to more than 25 users, please contact Microsoft Customer Support.

These admin-led trials are available worldwide. They are not available for Microsoft 365 Government customers.

The expiration date is shown in the trial subscription details page within the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once the trial expires, users will not be able to access their content on Viva Pulse and will have to reach out to their IT Admin to purchase a paid license. You will have 90 days to renew your subscription after the trial expires. After the 90-day grace period, all data will be deleted.

## Activate a trial

The Microsoft 365 Global Admin or the Billing Admin can activate the trial and assign licenses.

When you initiate a trial, you need to:

* Assign licenses to the relevant users.
* Inform the trial users to access Viva Pulse by adding and opening the Viva Pulse app on Microsoft Teams or by visiting [Viva Pulse in the web browser](https://pulse.viva.cloud.microsoft/). For more information, see [Access Viva Pulse in Microsoft Teams or web](../setup-admin-access/access-pulse-via-teams-or-web.md).

## Use the trial

The trial period should be used to evaluate the following components of Viva Pulse:

* Request feedback in Viva Pulse  
* Provide feedback in Viva Pulse  
* View and share feedback results in Viva Pulse  

For more adoption resources, visit our [Adoption page](https://adoption.microsoft.com/viva/pulse).

## After a trial

Based on the outcome of the trial, you can decide whether to proceed to purchase licenses to Viva Pulse.

To ensure continuity of service, you must purchase the required number of licenses and assign those licenses to users.

You must move users from your free trial subscription to the new subscription **before your 90-day grace period ends**. By doing this, you keep your data, accounts, and configuration. Otherwise, that information is deleted.
