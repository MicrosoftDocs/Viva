# Supported languages

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Private Preview program to access it. Features are subject to change.

### Languages available in the UI

Viva Pulse is currently available in English only. Support for additional languages will be added shortly.
Any content added by users (for example, when feedback providers are entering responses for open-ended questions) is displayed in the language in which it was entered.

For information about supported languages in other Viva applications and services, see [Microsoft Viva language support](/viva/viva-language-support.md).
