# Create a pulse

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to a preview version of Microsoft Viva Pulse. You must be in the Private Preview program to access it. Features are subject to change.

Feedback authors can request pulses from their teams by using research-backed templates.

## Create a pulse as a feedback author in Viva Pulse

1. Three methods exist to create Pulse requests.
    - Select one of the research-backed templates in the **Get started by asking for feedback on…** section on the Viva Pulse homepage.
    - Select **Send a pulse** in the **Welcome** section on the Viva Pulse homepage.
    - Select **Start a new pulse** on the Viva Pulse homepage **My pulses** section, under the **Pulses sent tab**.
1. Preview the questions in the template you selected and review the types of questions that are asked: rating, multiple choice, and open-ended.
1. If customization is enabled for your organization, add your own questions to the end of any of the templates and update the template name to personalize the Pulse request to your team’s needs:
    1. Choose from rating, multiple choice, or open-ended questions.
    1. Click the pencil icon next to the template name to update the title of your Pulse request. Note that a customized Pulse can include up to 25 questions in total.
1. Select feedback providers from individuals and groups, with the total number of feedback providers selected meeting the minimum confidentiality threshold needed to view feedback results.
1. Add a personal note if applicable and select **Send request**.
1. Sending the request will trigger a Teams Activity Feed notification to the selected feedback providers for them to provide their feedback.
1. Select **Copy link** to copy a link to your Pulse request that you can share with the selected feedback providers in a personal email or Teams message after you send your request, or later from the homepage.
1. If you have not obtained enough responses to meet the minimum confidentiality threshold needed to review the feedback results three days prior to the Pulse request deadline, you will receive a Teams Activity Feed notification to either extend the deadline or add feedback providers.
