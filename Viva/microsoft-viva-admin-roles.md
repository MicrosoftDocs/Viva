# Admin roles and tasks in Microsoft Viva
Setup and management of the Microsoft Viva suite starts with the Microsoft 365 global admin. The Microsoft 365 global admin can then assign additional roles for the management, tasks, and maintenance of each Viva app.

Admin options and permissions for each app rely heavily on the environments the apps are available in. For example, most Viva apps are accessed through Microsoft Teams and rely on the Microsoft Teams permissions structure.

In this article, we bring together information on the types and levels of admin roles for each Viva app.

## Admin roles in Microsoft Viva

## Roles spanning Microsoft Viva apps
The two roles that span Microsoft Viva apps are the Microsoft 365 global admin and the Microsoft Teams admin.

#### Microsoft 365 global admin

The Microsoft 365 admin role spans the Viva suite. A Microsoft 365 global admin sets up Viva, manages licenses and settings, and can assign the following roles, which may be required for some apps and tasks:

- Viva Topics - [administrator for Topics](/viva/topics/topic-experiences-roles#viva-topics-admin) (must be SharePoint admin and Groups admin)
- Viva Learning - [Knowledge admin](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#knowledge-administrator)
- Viva Insights - [Insights Business Leader](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#insights-business-leader), [Insights Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#insights-administrator), and [Insights Analyst](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#insights-analyst)
- SharePoint - [SharePoint admin](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator)
- Teams - [Teams admin](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#teams-administrator)
- Viva Engage - Engage admin ([Yammer administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#yammer-administrator))
- Answers in Viva Engage - Answers admin ([Knowledge manager](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#knowledge-manager))

Learn more about [admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

Learn about [Built-in Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

#### Microsoft Teams admin

The Teams admin manages the Teams service and creates and manages Microsoft 365 Groups. Teams admins can access everything in the Microsoft Teams admin center and associated PowerShell controls.

For Viva, the Teams admin manages the [deployment of Viva apps](/microsoftteams/manage-apps) and some settings for the apps.

For more information, see [Use Microsoft Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles).

## Admin and management roles for each app

Deciding who should be assigned roles will partly depend on how much access you want a person to have.

For example, you might want to give someone site owner permissions so they can create and manage your Viva Connections dashboard. This person would also be able to manage permissions for that site, edit the home page and other pages, delete pages and other site contents, and more.

To help you decide who should be assigned which roles, here are the overviews of roles for each app and what they do in Viva.<br><br>

### Viva Insights
In Viva Insights, you can assign multiple roles to one person. For example, one person can be both an Insights Administrator and an Insights Analyst.
