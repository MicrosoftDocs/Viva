# Provider Permissions

You can control access to all catalog and content from a provider so a specific set of user groups can discover the content in Viva Learning.
Content from a provider is discoverable by everyone in your organization, by default. When content is shown to everyone, the access column displays "Public."

> [!NOTE]
> - Any changes to permissions - adding, editing, or deleting - can take up to two hours to reflect in Viva Learning.
> - You can select up to a maximum of ten user groups.
> - Only Microsoft 365 groups and Mail Enabled Security groups are supported.
> - Only members of the chosen groups can view the provider and its content within viva learning.
