# Set up Microsoft Viva Learning in the Teams admin center

## Prerequisites

You need to have Microsoft Teams deployed for your organization in order to use Viva Learning.

## Licensing

Your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Enterprise subscription includes Viva Learning with basic features. However, you need a Viva Learning or Viva Suite license to access premium features. [Learn more about licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/learning?rtc=1).

## Admin roles and permissions

To set up learning content sources in Viva Learning and manage individual licensing, you need these permissions:

- [Microsoft Teams admin](/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles)
- [Microsoft 365 global admin](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) or [SharePoint admin](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) (to configure SharePoint as a learning content source)
- [Knowledge admin](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#knowledge-administrator)

The knowledge admin is a Microsoft Entra role in the Microsoft 365 admin center that can be assigned to anyone in the organization. This role manages the organization's learning content sources. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#knowledge-administrator) and [Overview of Microsoft Learning](overview-viva-learning.md).

## Set up Viva Learning

Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to set up and manage settings for Viva Learning.



The functionalities of the Microsoft 365 admin center include:

- Manage settings for learning content sources
- Assign knowledge administrator
- Pin Learning in Teams
- Manage availability in Teams admin center
- Manage other settings in Viva Learning through the Teams app

In the above example you can:

- See at a glance which settings are required or optional in the Priority column.
- Select a setting in the list, and get a panel where you can set the options without leaving the page. In this example, you see the panel to assign knowledge managers.

For more information, see [The Microsoft Viva admin experience](/viva/new-microsoft-viva-admin-experience).

Viva Learning is enabled by default for all Microsoft Teams users in your organization. You can turn off or turn on Viva Learning at the organization level on the **Manage apps** page in the Microsoft Teams admin center. For more information, see [Manage your apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](/microsoftteams/manage-apps).

To allow or block specific users in your organization from using Viva Learning, make sure Viva Learning is turned on for your organization on the **Manage apps** page in the Microsoft Teams admin center. Then create a custom app permission policy and assign it to those users. For more information, see [Manage app permission policies in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-app-permission-policies).

## Deploy Viva Learning to your users

Viva Learning is available to users from the Microsoft Teams app store. [Learn how to add apps to Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-an-app-to-microsoft-teams-b2217706-f7ed-4e64-8e96-c413afd02f77).

## Enable progress tracking for recommendations 

You can enable and disable progress tracking for recommendations for your users.

In the Microsoft Admin Center, go to: 

1. **Settings** > **Viva** > **Viva Learning**.

2. Select **Manage additional settings in Viva Learning**.

3. Check or uncheck the following setting: **Allow users to track their recommended trainings.**
