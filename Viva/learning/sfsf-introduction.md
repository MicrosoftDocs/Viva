# Overview of SAP SuccessFactors

Organizations with a Viva Learning Premium license who use SAP SuccessFactors as their learning management system (LMS) can ingest course catalogs, assignments, learning paths, program, and permission defined at SuccessFactors into Viva Learning. 
This is achieved through a connector developed by Viva Learning in partnership with SAP SuccessFactors. 

This article describes the workflow of this process and links to topics outlining each major step of the implementation. 

## Prerequisites 

Admins need the following permissions: 

- Access to Viva Learning admin.
- Access to Learning Administration in the SAP SuccessFactors portal.

## Workflow 

The SAP SuccessFactors integration with Viva Learning involves 4 stages: 

1. Generating PGP Key pairs (private and public) using Kleopatra
2. Configuring the SuccessFactors portal
3. Configuring Viva Learning in the Microsoft 365 admin center (MAC)
4. Enabling features for catalog sync, learner record sync, and catalog permissions

## Dataflow architecture

SAP SuccessFactors provides the content, learner records, programs, permissions for organizations. Viva Learning then extracts these records from the learning management system (LMS) through the LMS connector.

After the SuccessFactors integration is set up, SuccessFactors uploads the initial full Data Extract package onto the organization's SFTP server. The daily delta packages are subsequently sent zipped. 
This contains data on catalog, assignment, program, and permission. The package is then consumed by the LMS Fetcher component of SuccessFactors connectors. The package is subsequently stored, decrypted, processed and finally stored in the tenant shard and Azure database.
 
These data packages generated by SuccessFactors can comprise of the following:
 - Full data package: contains the full data dump of all the table files. This is denoted as `<Customer Name>_F_YYYYMMDDHH24MISSzip.pgp`
 - Delta data package: contains only data files updated in last 24 hours. This is denoted as `<Customer Name>_D_YYYYMMDDHH24MISSzip.pgp`

You can bring programs or learning paths from SAP SuccessFactors into Viva Learning. The programs are ingested along with the other content catalog items.

If you’re setting up SuccessFactors integration for your tenant for the first time, programs will be automatically ingested along with other content.

If you’ve already integrated SuccessFactors and want to bring in programs, you’ll need to request the SuccessFactors support team to regenerate the full sync package for your tenants. Viva Learning will ingest the programs for your tenant once the package becomes available in your SuccessFactors folder path.
