# Search preference settings

Learning admins and knowledge admins with Viva Learning premium licenses can set search preference settings for a customized content experience for users in their organization. 


## Prioritize content by provider

Use the **Prioritized provider** settings to prioritize the content that users can search on Viva Learning.

Here are some cases in which provider prioritization enhance the learning experience:

- Creating proprietary learning content in your organization for users under a specific provider
- Prioritizing content that is important for users 
- Prioritizing a provider that is preferred by either admins or most users

### Setting details
 
**Prioritized provider** is set to **None** by default. You can choose any one provider from the list of all available providers in the tenant. After confirming the provider selection, all content from the chosen provider is prioritized for Viva Learning users in your organization.

Prioritization is visible in the following Viva Learning spaces:

- Home page 
    - **Browse by** section
    - **Interests** section
- **Search results** page
- All search options in the Admin tab and the **Collections** tab in the **My Learning** page.
- **Related courses** section in the Learning content details page 

Updates to this setting are reflected immediately to all users and spaces.

> [!NOTE] 
> - Provider-based content prioritization boosts the provider content when compared to no prioritization. 
> - Provider-based content prioritization doesn't guarantee that the provider’s content is always visible to users. It also depends on user query and information available on the learning content, such as title, description, skill tags and keywords. 
> - Provider-based content prioritization is only applicable to Viva Learning spaces. Search in Microsoft 365 surfaces isn't impacted by this setting.

## Upcoming features

In future releases, we plan to enhance provider-based content prioritization with controls for levels of prioritization and the option to choose subsources within a provider.
