# Configure OpenSesame as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

This article shows you how to configure OpenSesame as a third-party learning content source in Viva Learning. You'll need a Microsoft Viva Suite or Viva Learning license to add OpenSesame as a content source for your organization.

>Content accessible through Viva Learning is subject to terms other than the Microsoft Product Terms. Go1 content and any associated services are subject to Go1's privacy and service terms.

With more than 25,000 curated courses from over 150 publishers, OpenSesame helps companies develop productive and admired workforces. [Learn more about OpenSesame.](https://www.opensesame.com/site/lms-integrations-viva/)

## Configure in your OpenSesame portal

>You'll need to have admin permissions in OpenSesame to complete these steps. You’ll also need an identity provider (IdP), as this integration uses SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.

You'll need to reach out to your OpenSesame Customer Success Manager or Implementation Specialist to enable integration with Viva Learning. They'll also provide your OpenSesame Customer Integration ID, which you'll need for the next step. You can view the full details in OpenSesame’s [PDF walkthrough guide](https://resources.opensesame.com/implementations/Viva-Learning-OpenSesame-integration-walkthrough.pdf).
