# Manage providers in Viva Learning

You can configure providers from **Manage Providers** in Viva Learning Admin. 

The **Add Provider** list shows you the available providers for configuration. Once a provider is confirmed, it appears on the **Configured Providers** list. 


> [!NOTE]
> Features in the Viva Learning Admin tab require both:
> - Viva Suite or Viva Learning license
> - Global admin, knowledge admin, or knowledge manage role
  
Review this article to [Learn how to assign roles](../microsoft-viva-admin-roles.md).

To create a set of featured content that displays up for your users, select the **Create featured set** in the top left corner.


## Managing Providers

Navigate to **Manage Providers** for a detailed view of all configured learning providers and to manage the learning providers and respective offerings. See [Manage learning management systems](../learning/configure-lms.md) and [Add other content providers](../learning/configure-other-content-sources.md) for more information.

The following features are accessible by the listed admin roles: 

**Manage Providers**: global admin, knowledge admin, knowledge manager (read only)
**Admin Tab**: global admin, knowledge admin, knowledge manager 


### Manage Providers Configuration 


You can configure providers using **Manage providers** in Viva Learning Admin. The **Add providers** list displays the available providers for configuration. 
Once a provider is configured, it appears in the **Configured providers** list. 

Adding a provider requires either a Global Admin or Knowledge Admin role. Review this [article](../microsoft-viva-admin-roles.md) to Learn how to assign roles. 


You can edit or delete an existing configured provider directly from **Manage providers**. 


> [!NOTE]
> - There are some configuration fields you can't edit once a provider is configured. These fields are unique identifier for each provider connection.
> - By making them non-editable, we make sure that each provider is uniquely pointed to a single data source to prevent data duplication or loss.
> - If you are required to edit these fields, reconfigure the provider.

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete all learning providers, the Viva Learning Teams app will be empty.

1. Open the **Viva Learning** App in Teams or go to the Viva Learning [Web App](https://aka.ms/VivaLearningWeb).

1. Select **Add Provider**. 

1. Select the provider you want to configure and select **Next**. 

1. Add provider configurations as applicable and select **Save**. This action adds the provider in the **Configured providers** list. 

You can track the following details: current sync status, last successful sync time, next scheduled sync time, ingestion logs, and trigger full sync for each component in the expanded view.

 - **Sync status** and **timestamp**: Check the current sync status (success/failed/in progress) of catalog, learner records, and catalog permissions.  
    
 - **Manual sync trigger**: Trigger the sync manually for a delta/full sync. Once a full sync is triggered, the sync status is updated accordingly. 

 - **Export log**: Admins can refer to the export log file for a detail about successful and failed sync cycles. 

> [!NOTE]
> The sync status, sync time stamp and export logs are only currently available for catalog sync for all providers. 
>Sync status and sync timestamp for learner records are only available for SAP SuccessFactor. Manual sync trigger is only available for catalog in SharePoint and SAP SuccessFactor.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend an aspect ratio of 16:9 for images to render properly in Viva Learning.
