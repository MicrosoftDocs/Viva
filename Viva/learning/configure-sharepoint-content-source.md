# Add SharePoint as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

You can configure SharePoint as a learning content source to make your organization's own content available in Viva Learning.

> [!NOTE]
> Content accessible through Viva Learning is subject to terms other than the Microsoft Product Terms. Any content you add to Viva Learning, such as SharePoint-hosted content, is subject to the privacy and service terms associated with that content.

## Overview

The knowledge admin (or global administrator) provides a site URL to where the [Learning Service](configure-sharepoint-content-source.md#learning-service) can create an empty centralized location in the form of a structured SharePoint list. This list is called the Learning App Content Repository. Your organization can use this list to house links to cross-company SharePoint folders that contain learning content. Admins are responsible for collecting and curating a list of URLs for folders. These folders should only include content that can be made available in Viva Learning.


![Diagram that shows the process of getting content from folders to a SharePoint list into Viva Learning, as described in the paragraph above.](../media/learning/sp-dataflow-infographic.png)

Viva Learning supports the following document types:

- Word, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF
- Audio (.m4a, .mp3)
- Video (.mov, .mp4, .avi)
- [Linked objects](#add-linked-objects)

For more information, see [SharePoint limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/sharepoint-online-service-description/sharepoint-online-limits?redirectSourcePath=%252farticle%252fSharePoint-Online-limits-8f34ff47-b749-408b-abc0-b605e1f6d498).

>[!NOTE]
> You can use either a Modern or Classic SharePoint site. You can choose whether to use an existing site or create a new SharePoint site based on your organization's needs.

>[!NOTE]
> Ensure that the SharePoint site is a communication site. This functionality isn't compatible with team sites.


## Learning Service

The Learning Service uses the provided folder URLs to get metadata from all content stored in those folders. Within 24 hours of supplying the folder URL in the centralized repository, employees can search for and use your organization's content within Viva Learning. All changes to content, including updated metadata and permissions, will also be applied in the Learning Service within 24 hours.

## Configure SharePoint as a source

>[!NOTE]
> You must be a Microsoft 365 global administrator or knowledge admin to perform these tasks.

>[!NOTE]
> The admin tab is only available for admins with a Viva Suite or Viva Learning license.


To configure SharePoint as a learning content sources in for Viva Learning, follow these steps:

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org settings**.

2. On the **Org settings** page, on the **Services** tab, select **Viva Learning**.

     ![Settings page in the Microsoft 365 admin center showing Viva Learning listed.](../media/learning/clcs-services.png)

3. On the **Viva Learning** panel, under SharePoint, provide the site URL to the SharePoint site where you want Viva Learning to create a centralized repository. If your SharePoint site is new, you'll need to wait 1 hour after site creation to add it here. You must also be the owner of the SharePoint site.

     ![Learning panel in the Microsoft 365 admin center showing SharePoint selected.](../media/learning/sharepoint-1.png)

     If your organization uses [Microsoft 365 Multi-geo](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo), you can find your region or country at [Microsoft 365 Multi-geo availability](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo#microsoft-365-multi-geo-availability). The **Viva Learning** panel also shows this information.

     ![Learning panel in the Microsoft 365 admin center showing a message that the SharePoint URL must be in the central location.](../media/learning/sharepoint-2.png)

4. A SharePoint list is created automatically within the provided SharePoint site.

     In the left navigation of the SharePoint site, select **Site contents** > **Learning App Content Repository**.

     ![SharePoint list showing the Site contents navigation and the Learning App Content Repository section.](../media/learning/learning-sharepoint-configure4.png)

5. On the **Learning App Content Repository** page, populate the SharePoint list with URLs to the learning content folders. Read [Folder URL document library curation](#folder-url-document-library-curation) for details about how to create the content folders.

   1. Select **New** to view the **New item** panel.

       ![Learning Content Repository page in SharePoint showing the New option.](../media/learning/learning-sharepoint-configure5.png)

   2. On the **New item** panel, in the **Title** field, add a directory name of your choice. In the **Folder URL** field, add the URL to the learning content folder. Select **Save**. [Learn how to to create the folder URL](#folder-url-document-library-curation).

       [![New item panel in SharePoint showing the Title and Folder URL fields.](../media/learning/learning-sharepoint-configure6.png)](../media/learning/learning-sharepoint-configure6-big.png#lightbox)

   3. The **Learning App Content Repository** page is updated with the new learning content.

       ![Learning Content Repository page in SharePoint showing the updated information.](../media/learning/learning-sharepoint-configure7.png)

   4. If your organization uses [Microsoft 365 Multi-geo](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo) and you try to add a link to a folder that doesn't belong to the central location, you'll get an error message. All folders need to belong to the central location.
    In case you encounter issues with content, refer to the [export log file](/viva/learning/use-tabs?view=o365-worldwide#managing-providers) for a detailed summary of successful and failed content ingestion.
   
       ![Error message in the New item panel saying that all uploaded folders need to be in the central location.](../media/learning/learning-sharepoint-configure-geo2.png)

  > [!NOTE]
  > To allow for broader access to the Learning App Content Repository, a link to the list soon will be available in the Viva Learning interface where users can request access and ultimately help populate the list. Site owners and global administrators will be required to grant access to the list. Access is specific to the list only and does not apply to the site where the list is stored. For more information, see [Provide your own organization's content](#provide-your-own-organizations-content) later in this article.

>[!NOTE]
> Viva Learning ingests up to 1000 items and files as learning objects.

### Folder URL document library curation

Create a folder to store learning content for your organization.

1. Go to your Documents library and select **+ New** and choose **Folder**.

## Multi-geo

[Microsoft 365 Multi-geo](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-multi-geo) is designed to meet data residency requirements.


The site URL provided by the knowledge admin where the Learning App Content Repository resides needs to belong to the central location where your Microsoft 365 subscription was originally provisioned. 

Folders linked to in the repository should also belong to the central location. Viva Learning has added this restriction to conform to data residency requirements. 

In case you encounter issues with content, refer to the [export log file](/viva/learning/use-tabs?view=o365-worldwide#managing-providers) for a detailed summary of successful and failed content ingestions.

For more information, see [Multi-geo capabilities in SharePoint Online](/microsoft-365/enterprise/multi-geo-capabilities-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-online-in-microsoft-365).
