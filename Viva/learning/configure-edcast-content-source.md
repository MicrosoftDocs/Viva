# Configure EdCast as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

This article shows you how to configure EdCast as a third-party learning content source in Viva Learning. You'll need a Microsoft Viva Suite or Viva Learning license to add EdCast as a content source for your organization.

## Configure in your EdCast portal

>[!NOTE]
>Your organization must have an active subscription to EdCast as well as a premium license for Microsoft Viva Learning.

You'll need Your EdCast API key, Secret, Client Host URL and User Email for Viva Learning to surface content from your EdCast instance.

1. Your organization's EdCast administrator can obtain your EdCast API key and Secret by reaching out to your dedicated EdCast Customer Success Manager.

2. Your Client host URL will be the same as your EdCast instance URL. It should look like "[subdomain].edcast.com".

## Configure in your Microsoft 365 admin center

1. Sign in to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

3. Fill in the configuration details that you got from your EdCast Customer Success Manager.
