# Optional connected experiences in Viva Learning


As an admin, you can provide users in your organization with the ability to use one or more cloud-backed services (also referred to as optional connected experiences) while using Viva Learning. 
This includes URL preview service and spell check. These cloud-backed services are optional. They're offered to under their respective service terms that differ from those in [Microsoft Online Service Terms](https://microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Licensing-Use-Rights).


 You can give or restrict your users' ability to use optional connected experiences. You can do this by using the [Office cloud policy service](/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy) and configuring the **Allow the use of additional optional connected experiences in Office policy** setting. This is the same policy setting that controls whether optional connected experiences are available to your users in the Office apps (such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) that come with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. 

Once you provide users with the ability to use optional connected experiences in Viva Learning, they can go to **Settings** > **Privacy** in Viva Learning and choose whether to use optional connected experiences. 

## URL Preview service 

The URL Preview service automatically generates a preview snippet and autofills the metadata like title, description, and thumbnail while user [adds link to content](learning-path-add-link.md) in Viva Learning. This service makes a request to the service URL as the user is typing the message. 

If the service URL doesn't have any schema.org data, it sends a request to Bing search to get the data it needs to generate the preview snippet. Experiences that rely on Bing are licensed to you under the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement](https://microsoft.com/servicesagreement) and covered by the [privacy statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). Any URLs you provide to Microsoft Teams while using these services can be sent to Microsoft Bing, including Bing Content Validation Service for evaluation of harmful content. They aren't linked to you by the Bing organization.
