- Word, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF 
- Audio (.m4a, .mp3) 
- Video (.mov, .mp4, .avi) 
- [Linked objects](#add-linked-objects)

## Add linked objects

You can add links to both internal content from SharePoint and external content from sites such as YouTube or Vimeo included in Viva Learning.

To add a SharePoint page or SharePoint site, create a linked object and add the link using this process:

1. In your folder, select **New** and then choose **Link**. 


   :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the documents library with New and Link selected." source="../media/learning/sp-new-link.png" lightbox="../media/learning/sp-new-link.png":::

1. Add the URL and choose a name.

1. Select **Create**. 

1. The link appears in your document library with the name you selected. 


    ![Screenshot of the documents library with a new file called Azure.url.](../media/learning/sp-linkinlibrary.png)

The linked object now displays in the Viva Learning app.
