# Enable or disable the Learning tab in Bing, Office.com, and SharePoint

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need a Viva Learning or Viva Suite license to access this feature. [Learn more about licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/learning)

Users in your organization can search for learning opportunities from the search bar in SharePoint, Office.com, the Office app, and the Work tab in Bing. The **Learning** tab is enabled by default in these apps.  

## Disable the learning tab

1. Navigate to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Go to **Settings**, then select **Search & intelligence**.
3. Go to the **Customizations** tab, then choose **Verticals**.
4. Select the **Learning** vertical checkbox. Then select the **Enable/Disable** button to show or hide the Learning tab in Microsoft 365 search.

It can take a few hours for this change to reflect in the Search apps.
