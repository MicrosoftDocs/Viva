# Enable inline playback

Viva Learning and SAP SuccessFactors integration allows seamless authentication (SSO) and in-app playback. Users can access SAP SuccessFactors content inline within Viva Learning instead of launching content in a browser.  

Inline playback is optimized for Teams desktop and web. It loads the SuccessFactors embedded player.

SAP SuccessFactors does not provide support for embedded content player in mobile applications. When using the Teams mobile app, inline playback loads the SAP SuccessFactors details page.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The ability to play SAP SuccessFactors courses inline in Viva Learning is supported for SuccessFactors version 2205 (May 2022) and earlier. Changes introduced within the SuccessFactors 2211 (November 2022) release breaks the in-app play of content. We are currently working with SAP SuccessFactors to resolve this issue and will provide updates as soon as they are available.

Content classified as online and instructor-led with online are consumed within Viva Learning and other content classifications are launched in the browser.

## Pre-requisite for enabling in-app playback and SSO

Refer to the [Azure Active Directory (AAD) single sign-on (SSO) integration with SAP SuccessFactors](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/successfactors-tutorial) topic for configuration information on enabling in-app playback and SSO.

Ensure that the SSO configuration on AAD and SAP SuccessFactors is the same and that the users login method on SAP SuccessFactors is set to "SSO."

Log in to Teams and Windows with the same user account for seamless consumption of SAP SuccessFactors content within Viva Learning.

You may encounter a "refused to connect" error or a blank screen the first time you consume SAP SuccessFactors content inline within Viva Learning. The content plays successfully on subsequent content launches, however. To resolve this issue, refer to the SAP Knowledge Base Article - [2169861](https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2169861).

>[!NOTE]
> If the SSO on both AAD and SAP SuccessFactors are already configured in the tenant, as described in the above documentation, then no action is required.
