# Enable Learner Record Sync


Enable learner record synch to enable assignments and course completion records to sync from the learning management system (LMS) to Viva Learning. Users from your organization will then be able to see their assigned and completed courses from your LMS within Viva Learning.  

By checking the **Enable Learner Record Sync** checkbox, you're allowing Viva Learning to fetch user information, user assignments, and completed courses.
Viva Learning gets the learner records from the package generated by SuccessFactors for their tenant in the SFTP folder.

Each learner has a unique attribute called **PERSON_ID_EXTERNAL** in the “PV_PARTNER_STUDENT” file within the generated package. 

Viva Learning synchronizes the associated learner records with the help of **PERSON_ID_EXTERNAL** data and tries to match with the **employeeID** attribute in AAD.

The user information from the LMS is only used for user mapping, and doesn't remain in storage. Only mapped learner record information is deduced.  


>[!NOTE]
>The full sync file needs to be generated from SAP SuccessFactors if you enable the learner record sync at a later stage after enabling catalog sync.

## Prerequisite for learner record sync

You'll need to enable inbound user provisioning with SAP SuccessFactors to ensure all users in Azure Active Directory have the right employeeID configured. The steps required to enable this integration may vary depending on how your Azure Active Directory tenant is configured.

Refer to the scenario table below to pick the right integration steps for your setup.

| Scenario | Do you have on-premises Active Directory? | Do you have an Azure AD tenant? | Are you using [AAD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis) or [Cloud sync](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync) to sync on-premises identities to Azure AD? | Are you synchronizing employee data from SAP SuccessFactors to on-premises AD or Azure AD? | Recommended integration steps |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Scenario 1   | Yes | Yes  | Yes  | No  | - Review the cloud HR provisioning [deployment plan](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision).<br> - Configure [SAP SuccessFactors inbound user provisioning to on-premises Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-tutorial).  |
| Scenario 2   | No  | Yes  | NA   | No  | - Review the cloud HR provisioning [deployment plan](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision).<br> - Configure [SAP SuccessFactors inbound user provisioning to Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-cloud-only-tutorial). |
| Scenario 3   | Yes | Yes  | Yes  | Yes | - If you're synchronizing SAP SuccessFactors data to on-premises AD using an IAM tool like Microsoft Identity Manager or a middleware service and the `employeeID` information is already present in AD and Azure AD then there is no additional configuration required.  |
| Scenario 4   | Yes | No   | No   | No  | - [Configure Azure AD tenant](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant) with Premium P1 license. <br>-  Review the cloud HR provisioning [deployment plan](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision) and setup [SuccessFactors to AD inbound provisioning](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-tutorial). <br>- [Set up AAD Connect Sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis) or [Cloud sync](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync). |
| Scenario 5   | Yes | Yes  | No   | No  | - Review the cloud HR provisioning [deployment plan](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/plan-cloud-hr-provision) and setup [SuccessFactors to AD inbound provisioning](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-tutorial). <br>- [Set up AAD Connect Sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis) or [Cloud sync](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync). |
| Scenario 6   | Yes | Yes  | No   | Yes | - [Set up AAD Connect Sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sync-whatis) or [Cloud sync](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/what-is-cloud-sync). |

## Steps followed for user sync

After you enable user sync, the EmployeeID is synced with each LMS user synced to Azure Active Directory.  

Viva Learning receives this EmployeeID in a zip package in an encrypted form, which is used for StudentID matching. As this information can only be decrypted by keys provided by admins, Viva Learning has no way to access this manually.
