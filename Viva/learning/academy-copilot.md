- **Create learning paths**: Start by creating learning paths that mirror learning paths available in the Copilot Academy. This step forms the foundation of your custom academy. 

- **Add to your new academy**: Once your learning paths are set, you can seamlessly integrate them into your new academy for a personalized learning experience.
