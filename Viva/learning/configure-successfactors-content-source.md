# Configure SAP SuccessFactors as a content source for Microsoft Viva Learning

This article shows you how to configure SAP SuccessFactors as a third-party content source for Microsoft Viva Learning. First, you'll need to edit the system configuration in the SuccessFactors Portal, then you'll need to complete the configuration in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

>[!NOTE]
>Content accessible through Viva Learning is subject to terms other than the Microsoft Product Terms. SAP SuccessFactors content and any associated services are subject to the SAP SuccessFactors privacy and service terms.

## Configure in your SuccessFactors portal

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to have admin permissions in SuccessFactors to complete these steps.

1. Obtain the required workflows to edit the PARTNER_EXTRACT configuration, which you can get to by going to **System Administration** > **Configuration** > **System Configuration** > **PARTNER_EXTRACT**.

2. Use the PGP tool to generate the PGP key (Public key, Private Key, Private Key Passphrase) of your preferred size. While generating the PGP key, you can select RSA algorithm, which is recommended. GNUPG tool is one of the PGP keys generation tools that you can use.
To generate private and public PGP key pairs, you can work with your IT admin or follow the guidelines in the [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/).

   1. For Windows
       1. Get GNU Privacy Guard for Windows by going to [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/) and selecting **Download**.
       2. Go to **About Gpg4win** and choose **Documentation** to view the documentation. Download the latest version.
       3. Follow the installation instructions after downloading the software.
       4. In the documentation that you downloaded, go to section 7: Creating a certificate.
       5. Create a new PGP key pair.
       6. Select **Make a Backup Of Your Key Pair** and save the secret file locally for future reference.
       7. Open the certificate details of the same certificate and export the public key value.
   2. For UNIX and Linux systems
       1. Download [GNU Privacy Guard](https://www.gnupg.org/).
       2. On the GnuPG website, go to **Documentation**, then choose **Guides**.
       3. Open the GNU Privacy Handbook.
       4. Follow the instructions in the section **Generating a new keypair**.

3. Fill in the following parameters in the PARTNER_EXTRACT configuration. To edit the partner extract configuration in SuccessFactors, you'll need **Edit System Configuration** workflow permission in SuccessFactors.

    - Customer notification email for all job status
        - defaultJob.email=
    
    - Partner1
        - The maximum length of PartnerID is 10 characters. For Microsoft Viva Learning enter the value **MVL**.
            - partners1.partnerID=
    
    - EncryptionKey is the PGP public encryption key, which is the entire section between BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK and END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK. Make sure to remove any line breaks in the key when you enter this value.
        - partners1.encryptionKey=
    
    - KeyOwner maps to the User-ID of public key
        - partners1.keyOwner=
    
    - enabled can be "false" or "true". Set it to "true" to enable the partner extract.
        - partners1.enabled=

Once you've completed these steps in the SuccessFactors portal, you'll need to complete the setup in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

>[!NOTE]
>Once you've finished the configuration in your SuccessFactors portal, SuccessFactors will generate the initial sync package. This may take up to 7 business days. Once the package is available in your SFTP folder path, Viva Learning will be able to begin communicating with SuccessFactors. If you can't find the package, contact your SuccessFactors support team.

## Configure in your Microsoft 365 admin center

>[!NOTE]
>You'll need to have admin permissions in Microsoft 365 to complete these steps.

### Prerequisite for configuration

Make sure that the SuccessFactors package is available in the SFTP folder path.

To obtain the folder path:

1. Navigate to **SF Admin Application** > **System Administration** > **Configuration** > **System Configuration** > **PARTNER_EXTRACT**.
2. Get the value of the defaultFtp.path property.

>[!NOTE]
>It may take up to 7 business days after configuration in your SuccessFactors portal for the SuccessFactors package to appear in your folder path. If you're still unable to find the package, contact your SuccessFactors support team.

### Admin center configuration

1. Navigate to your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).

2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Org settings**. Search for *Viva Learning* and enable SAP SuccessFactors from the options.

3. Fill in the configuration details:

    **Display Name**: Enter the display name you want to appear for the SAP SuccessFactors carousel.

    **SFTP Host URL**: Navigate to **LMS Admin Application** > **System Administration** > **Configuration** > **System Configuration** > **CONNECTORS**. Get the value of the `connector.ftp.server` property.

    **User Name**: Follow the same steps you followed for the SFTP Host URL. Get the value of the `connector.ftp.userID` property.

    **Password**: Enter your password. Check with your LMS application owner for help with retrieving your password.

    **Folder Path**: Navigate to **LMS Admin Application** > **System Administration** > **Configuration** > **System Configuration** > **PARTNER_EXTRACT**. Get the value of the `defaultFtp.path` property.

    **Client's Host URL**: This is the BizX domain URL. You can get this from your BizX login URL. For example, if your BizX login URL is `organization.successfactors.com/sf/start/#/login` then the host URL is `organization.successfactors.com`.

    **Client's Learning Destination URL**: You can get this from the learning domain module URL. For example, if the learning domain URL is `organization.scdemo.successfactors.com/learning/...` then the Learning Destination URL is `organization.scdemo.successfactors.com`.

    **PGP Private Key**: PGP private key for decryption, which is the entire section between BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK and END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK. You'll need to copy the key exactly as it's been generated; don't remove new line characters.

    Note that different tools generate keys in different formats. Remove the header if one is present in the block (for example, the version). Copy only the key block, which should be a Base64 string.

    **PGP Private Key Passphrase**: You'll need to get this value from your IT admin or the team that provides your PGP key.

    **Company ID**: Sign in to your SuccessFactors portal. Select your profile icon, then select **Show Version Settings**. You can view your company ID here.

4. Select **Save** to activate SuccessFactors content in Microsoft Viva Learning. There may be a delay before the content is available in Viva Learning.

>[!Note]
> SuccessFactors courses will start appearing in Viva Learning within 7 days of successful setup.

>[!Note]
> All users within an organization will be able to discover all the tenant-specific courses, but they'll only be able to access and consume courses that they have access to. User specific content discovery is planned for future releases.

## Learner record sync

Check the **Enable Learner Record Sync** checkbox to enable assignments and course completion records to sync from the learning management system to Viva Learning. Users from your organization will then be able to see their assigned and completed courses from your LMS within Viva Learning.  

By checking this checkbox, you're allowing Viva Learning to fetch user information, user assignments, and completed courses. The user information from the LMS is only used for user mapping, and doesn't remain in storage. Only mapping-related information is deduced.  

### Prerequisite for learner record sync

You'll need to enable inbound user provisioning from SAP SuccessFactors to Azure AD. [Learn how](/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/sap-successfactors-inbound-provisioning-cloud-only-tutorial)

### Steps followed for user sync

After you enable user sync, the EmployeeID is synced with each LMS user synced to Azure Active Directory.  

Viva Learning receives this EmployeeID in a zip package, which is used for StudentID matching.
