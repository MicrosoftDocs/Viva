# Use Microsoft 365 Groups permissions with SharePoint content in Viva Learning

Document library folder URLs can be collected from any SharePoint site in the organization. Viva Learning follows all existing content permissions. Therefore, only content for which a user has permission to access is searchable and visible within Viva Learning. Any content within these folders will be searchable, but only content to which the individual employee has permissions can be used.

>[!NOTE]
> While only **Microsoft 365** and **Mail-enabled security** group types are supported, it's recommended that you use a **Microsoft 365 Group.** Viva Learning doesn't support user-based permissions. Viva Learning won't ingest files that don't have associated Microsoft 365 Groups permissions.

1. Create a group by following the steps in [Create a group in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/create-groups) to create groups in your Microsoft 365 admin center.

>[!NOTE]
> You'll need to add the owners as members in order for them to have access.

2. Go to the folder where you're storing learning content in SharePoint.
3. Select the vertical ellipses (**...**) on the item you want to control access to. If you want to control access to specific items in a folder, go to that folder.
4. Select **Manage access**.

5. Select the plus icon (**+**) next to **Direct access**.

6. Start typing the email address of the group you want to give access to, then select the group.

7. By default, users in the group are given Edit permissions. Select the pencil icon to choose between Edit and View permissions. The pencil icon will have a slash through it if the group has only view permissions. Users need a minimum of Can View permission.

8. Select **Grant access** to give your group access to the learning content.

>[!NOTE]
> It will take approximately 24 hours for these changes to show up in the Viva Learning app.

## Remove unintentionally surfaced content

1. To restrict access to the document library, select the **Show actions** option, and then select **Manage access**.

2. Delete the original document within the document library.
