# Benchmarks in Viva Engage analytics

The _benchmarks_ feature in Viva Engage Premium shows how your metrics are performing in comparison to other customers that use Viva Engage. Only verified and network admins can enable benchmarks in Viva Engage.

## How we calculate benchmarks

Benchmarks provide percentiles that correspond to your current metrics.

For **Network Analytics**, this percentile uses the _People Engaged_ metric to tell you how engagement levels in your organization compare to similarly sized networks. The number of active users within an organization define the network size sectors. Both network administrators and corporate communicators can access the Networks Analytics benchmark on the **Network Activity** card.

For **Audience Analytics**, this percentile uses the _Audience members engaged_ metric to tell you how your engagement levels compare to all audiences in the same organization. Leaders, delegate managers, and delegates can access the Audience Analytics benchmark on the **Audience Engagement** card.

## Enable benchmarks

Verified and Network admins can turn benchmarks on or off from the Viva Engage admin center.

1. Go to [Viva Engage admin center on the web](http://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/admin).

1. On the **Setup & Configuration** tab, select **Analytics and AI**.

-  To enable benchmarks for Network analytics, go to **Network Analytics** and turn on **Benchmarks**.
  When enabled, this feature compares your engagement against networks of similar size that use Viva Engage. It may include your network data in aggregate benchmarks for comparative purposes only.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If less than 50% of the network’s users are licensed for *Viva Suite* or *Employee Communications and Communities*, the Network Analytics dashboard is unavailable. For precise percentile rankings, at least five similarly sized networks must also enable engagement benchmarks. Without this, benchmarks on Network Analytics won't be displayed.

- To enable benchmarks for Audience analytics, go to **Audience Analytics** and turn on **Benchmarks**.
    When this setting is enabled, leaders can see how their engagement in Viva Engage compares to that of other leaders in the same organization. Your audience data may be included in aggregate benchmark calculations for comparative purposes only.

### Optimize engagement in your network

Network administrators and corporate communicators can increase engagement, strengthen connections, and improve their benchmark metrics for Network Analytics by applying best practices in their network.

- Assign a peer as a [_corporate communicator_](/viva/engage/eac-key-admin-roles-permissions) to help moderate engagement across your organization.

- Assign more [_leaders_](/viva/engage/leadership-identification). Content posted by leaders tends to have higher engagement.

- Create posts about [campaigns](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/campaigns-in-viva-engage-d7b05128-f80b-4c16-b561-3ddce518eb14) on your [storyline](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/storyline-in-viva-engage-cba3c38e-77c6-4ee6-9d5d-6c20522b1fa0).

- Encourage leaders to post and interact with content.

### Optimize engagement in your audiences

Leaders, delegate managers, and delegates can increase engagement, strengthen connections, and improve benchmark metrics for audience analytics by applying best practices for content creation.

- Assign a member of your team as a [_delegate_](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/delegation-in-viva-engage-2f0a64a3-c5c0-45cd-b3f1-e1e06732f89f) to engage on a leader’s behalf.

- Create [storyline posts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/storyline-in-viva-engage-cba3c38e-77c6-4ee6-9d5d-6c20522b1fa0). Leadership content often generates higher engagement than average posts.
