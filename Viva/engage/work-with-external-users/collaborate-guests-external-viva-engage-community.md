# Collaborate with guests in a Viva Engage community

External collaboration is a key ingredient for the success of any organization. Viva Engage guests allow you to call in experts, such as consultants or vendors, from outside your organization. Users can invite guests to a community and quickly start a rich conversation by sharing access to community resources like files. This ease-of-use makes external collaboration one of the most used features in Viva Engage today.

There are two methods of working with guests, depending on how your organization’s Viva Engage network is structured. A Viva Engage network [aligned to native mode](../overview-native-mode.md) applies the Microsoft Entra B2B guest framework to power external users while a Viva Engage network that is currently not aligned to native mode uses the Viva Engage-specific guest framework.
