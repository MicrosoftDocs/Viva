# Collaborate with guests in a Viva Engage community

External collaboration is a key ingredient for the success of any organization. Viva Engage guests allow you to call in experts, such as consultants or vendors from outside your organization. Users can invite guests to a community and quickly start a rich conversation by sharing access to files and other community resources. This ease-of-use makes external collaboration one of the most used features in Viva Engage today.

There are two methods for working with external users. The structure of your Viva Engage network determines which method you use. If your Viva Engage network is [aligned to Native Mode](../overview-native-mode.md), you can use the Microsoft Entra Business-to-business (B2B) framework. If your Viva Engage network is not aligned to native mode, you can use the Viva Engage-specific guest framework.
