# Identify leaders and manage audiences in Viva Engage

Leaders naturally want to share vision, updates, and perspectives to build culture, manage change, and drive engagement with the people they lead. Viva Engage empowers leaders to more effectively connect with, communicate to, and listen to their employees. This begins with identifying leaders and the audiences they want to engage. Leadership identification and audience management enables organizations to designate leaders, configure their audience and even to connect leaders with the entire organization.

Leadership identification and audience management is a prerequisite for other leadership features of Viva Engage, including leadership announcements, campaigns, audience analytics, and Leadership Corner.

## Identify leaders

Engage admins, corporate communicators, existing Yammer verified admins, and Yammer network admins can identify leaders in Viva Engage. Leaders can be identified individually or by importing groups of leaders.

1. Within the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu to expose the admin option. Select **Admin** to navigate to the Engage admin center.

2. Under the **Feature management** tab, select **Leadership identification and audiences** to navigate to the **Manage leaders** page, where you can identify leaders by searching for users and groups.

3. Select **Add leaders** and enter the name of the user or group you would like to identify as leaders.

![View of the Engage admin center interface for adding leaders.](/Viva/media/engage/admin/add-leaders.png)

5. Select the user or group from the search results.
6. If you are importing a group, select **Continue** to confirm your choice.

Once confirmed, the group members and individuals you selected will be added as leaders in the **Manage leaders** list.

> [!NOTE]
> Subsequent changes to group memberships will not automatically update who is identified as a leader in Viva Engage. You can add the group again to add new members, or add and remove individual leaders.

## Manage a leader's audience

After a leader has been identified, the next step is to manage the leader’s audience, which can be performed by the Engage admin, Yammer verified admin, Yammer network admin, corporate communicator, and the leader or the leader's delegate managers.  

From the **Manage leaders** list, find the leader’s row and select the pencil icon on the right to edit.

![View of the interface for managing a leader's audience in Viva Engage.](/Viva/media/engage/admin/edit-audience.png)

This will lead you to the **Manage audiences** page, where you can configure the leader’s audience. A leader can have up to two audiences:

- **Entire organization**: The leader’s posts and announcements reach all users in the Viva Engage/Yammer network, excluding guests. To enable a leader to share and reach the entire organization, enable **Entire organization** toggle.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only Engage admins, Yammer verified admins, Yammer network admins and corporate communicators can allow leaders to reach the entire organization. Leaders and delegate managers cannot enable this toggle.  

- **Audience**: The audience represents people the leader wants to connect, communicate, and engage with most directly. This often means people in the leader’s immediate organization. To define an audience, use the search box to add users or groups.

![View of the Manage audience interface in Viva Engage.](/Viva/media/engage/admin/manage-audience.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Each time a Storyline announcement is posted, the selected audiences will receive an automatic notification.

You can define a leader’s audience by adding individual users or groups (security or distribution groups). When you add a group, **changes to the group’s membership (including nested members) automatically update the audience**, within 24 hours. This makes it easy to apply existing groups that define a leader’s organization to define the leader’s audience in Viva Engage.

Additionally, since customers may have existing distribution lists they use to communicate with an audience by email, you can simply add the same list(s) to the leader’s audience in Viva Engage for continuous communication.

## Set leader delegates and delegate managers

A leader’s communications (posts, stories, and announcements) in Viva Engage can be created and managed by delegates. A *delegate* has permission to create posts and replies on behalf of another user. A *delegate manager* has the same ability to create content, configure the audience for a leader, and assign additional delegates.

A leader can configure delegates through the following steps:

1. Within the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu to expose the dropdown list of options (see image at the top of this article for reference).
2. Select **Manage delegate settings**.

3. Add the name of the person who will be the delegate or delegate manager.

![View of the interface for Delegate Settings in Viva Engage.](/Viva/media/engage/admin/delegate-settings.png)

4. Choose the type of delegate.

    - A *delegate* can create posts on behalf of the user in any public or private Yammer community as long as both the delegate and the user have access to it.

    - A *delegate manager* can similarly create posts. A delegate manager can also configure a leader’s audience, and assign additional delegates or delegate managers.

    - As soon as a user gets a new delegate assigned to the delegate team, the user and the whole team of delegates will receive an email notifying them of this action.

    - When a delegate is removed, the same audience is notified via email.

5. If the delegate will create posts, stories, or announcements on the leader’s [Storyline](/Viva/engage/eac-storyline), **enable the Storyline toggle**.

## Leadership Corner

Leadership Corner in Viva Engage is a place for users to get to know their leaders and stay informed on the latest content they post. Users can visit Leadership Corner to catch up on the latest content leaders are posting, join their communities, and attend their AMAs to ask them questions directly. Leadership Corner gives your organization the tools they need to learn about their leaders and build lasting connections with them.

Leadership Corner is ON by default but can be disabled using the toggle in the Viva [Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac) by a Microsoft 365 Global admin or Engage admin. Follow the below steps to enable or disable Leadership Corner for your organization:

1. Select **Leadership corner** from the **Feature management tab** in the Engage admin center.

![View of the Leadership Corner toggle for admin.](/Viva/media/engage/admin/lc-admin-eac.png)

2. Use the toggle to enable or disable Leadership Corner for your organization.
