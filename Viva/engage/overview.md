# Introducing Microsoft Viva Engage

Viva Engage brings people together across the organization to connect with leaders, coworkers, and communities. It provides an experience where people can crowdsource answers and ideas, share their work and experience, and find belonging at work.  

Viva Engage is part of the Microsoft Viva employee experience platform built within Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams. The Viva suite of apps gives you the ability to support connection, insight, purpose, and growth in your organization using your existing infrastructure.

#### How is Viva Engage different from Viva Connections? 

Both apps are part of the Microsoft Viva experience and are more powerful when used together. **Viva Engage** provides the social fabric for Viva and Microsoft 365, while **Viva Connections** is the gateway to the entire Viva experience.  

**Viva Connections** is where people start their workday and quickly catch up with organizational news, tasks, and resources. **Viva Engage** brings community and conversations into the workplace. It’s the place you go to ask questions, share knowledge, build your social capital, and extend your network.

#### What happened to Yammer?

Viva Engage surfaces all of the existing and new employee experiences powered by Yammer services. Viva Engage users can access effectively the same content and feature set as Yammer and Yammer mobile apps with no loss of continuity. Outside of branding changes, there are no changes to the features, capabilities, and investments for Microsoft 365 customers.

#### How does the Viva Engage app in Teams compare to Yammer?

Generally, all features in Yammer are also in Viva Engage. However, the Viva Engage app lacks these capabilities:

- Playing live events and videos hosted in [Microsoft Stream (Classic)](/stream/overview) on iOS
- Viewing or editing the full community info
- Viewing community files stored in the SharePoint document library
