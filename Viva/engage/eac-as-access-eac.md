### Remove a user as a corporate communicator

To unassign a user from the role of corporate communicator for your network, select the **delete** icon on the right side of the corporate communicator list. 

>[!NOTE]
> While assigning a user to this role is a pre-licensed capability, the actions this user can perform depend on the nature of their license, core versus premium.

#### Corporate communicators can perform these tasks

- **Create campaigns**

- **Manage campaigns**:
    - Publish draft campaigns to be **Active** and viewable to all users in the network
    - Set Active campaigns to **Ended** when a campaign is finished
    - Republish reoccurring campaigns from **Ended** to **Active**
    - Delete campaigns that aren't relevant or were created by mistake
    - Update assets on a campaign page such as: goal tracker, cover photo, theme colors for the campaign hashtag, pinned posts, pinned resources and links

- **View campaign analytics**

- **Identify leaders**

- **Manage a leader's audiences**


## Configure your tenant

As a Microsoft 365 Global administrator or Engage administrator, you're encouraged to set up your Viva Engage enterprise experience for all users before they start to use the application. This practice helps maintain a consistent experience. Engage administrators can navigate to the **Setup and configuration** tab in the Viva Engage admin center and select **Configure tenant**.

Users are routed to the Viva Engage admin center, where they can perform the following actions:  

- [Configure the network](/viva/engage/configure-your-viva-engage-network/configure-viva-engage)
    - Set the tenant network name
    - Require users to confirm email messages before posting
    - Restrict who can upload files, and limit file formats
    - Allow Tenor GIFs in messages
    - Control how links are displayed
    - Allow message translation
    - Set the default system message language and more
- [Customize the look](/viva/engage/configure-your-viva-engage-network/customize-the-look-of-viva-engage)
- Manage domains in Microsoft 365  
- [Migrate a network to Native Mode](/viva/engage/configure-your-viva-engage-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide), if not already in Native Mode

>[!NOTE]
> Because Viva Engage is powered by Yammer technology, configuring the tenant through the Yammer admin center publishes changes to both Yammer and Viva Engage. We are working to bring these configuration options to the Viva Engage admin center as part of our admin roadmap.
