# Answers in Viva Engage: Frequently asked questions

**What license is required to use Answers?**

You need a license to Viva Engage Knowledge service plan to use Answers. This service plan is available as part of the Viva Suite or Viva Topics products.

**Can users who aren't assigned the Viva Engage Knowledge service plan use Answers?**

These users receive notifications to questions or answers where they're mentioned. They can view that question or answer but can't navigate the rest of the Answers experience.

**Where can I access resources for Answers adoption practices?**

See [Viva Engage Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/viva/engage/).

**Are posted questions visible to everyone in my company?**

Answers are visible to anyone in your organization who has a Viva Suite or Viva Topics license. Answers posts can be routed to anyone else in your organization who has a Microsoft 365 license, but those other employees can only access the individual thread, not other parts of Answers.

**Can admins disable the Answers Digest sent to their organization?**

Currently, admins can't configure or disable the automated Answers Digest emails from Answers in Viva.

**Is guest access permitted for Answers?**

Answers doesn't support guest access.

**Can our organization use Answers without Viva Topics?**

Answers uses Viva Topics to organize question conversations. Answers works for users who don't have a Viva Topics license if they have a license to the Viva Engage Knowledge service plan, which is bundled into Viva Topics or Viva Suite. The best Answers experience is when it's used alongside Viva Topics. Topics connects employees to the knowledge of an organization. It helps route questions to the people that are most likely able to have the answers. When Viva Topics are mined, curated, and managed, the Answers digest routing and questions for your feed are improved, as well as other aspects of Answers.

**Why canâ€™t users in my organization access Answers?**

Check that your Yammer network meets the [technical requirements](/viva/engage/eac-answers-overview-setup), and your users have the correct license to access Answers. Your Yammer network must be in Native mode and have legacy Yammer topics migrated to Viva Topics.
