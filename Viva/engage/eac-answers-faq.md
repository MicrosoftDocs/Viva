# Answers in Viva Engage: Frequently asked questions

**What license is required to use Answers?**

You need a license to Viva Engage Knowledge service plan to use Answers. This service plan is available as part of _Viva Suite_ and _Employee Communications and Communities_.

**Can users who aren't assigned the Viva Engage Knowledge service plan use Answers?**

These users receive notifications to questions or answers where they're mentioned. They can view that question or answer but can't navigate the rest of the Answers experience.

**Where can I access resources for Answers adoption practices?**

See [Viva Engage Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/yammer/).

**Are posted questions visible to everyone in my company?**

Answers are visible to anyone in your organization who has a Viva Suite license. Answers posts can be routed to anyone else in your organization who has a Microsoft 365 license, but those other employees can only access the individual thread, not other parts of Answers.

**Can admins disable the Answers Digest sent to their organization?**

Currently, admins can't configure or disable the automated Answers Digest emails from Answers in Viva.

**Is guest access permitted for Answers?**

Answers doesn't support guest access.

**Can our organization use Answers without Topics?**

Yes, Answers works with or without Viva Topics for users with the Viva Engage Knowledge Service plan. Employees with Viva Topics licensing have additional knowledge management experiences, such as Topics cards on hover and AI-suggested topics. In 2025, Viva Topics will be retired, but a simplified topics model will continue in Viva Engage. For details about the Viva Topics retirement, see [Changes coming to Topics](/microsoft-365/topics/changes-coming-to-topics?view=o365-worldwide).

**Why can’t users in my organization access Answers?**

Check that your Viva Engage network meets the [technical requirements](/viva/engage/eac-answers-overview-setup), and your users have the correct license to access Answers. Your Viva Engage network must be in Native mode and have legacy Viva Engage topics migrated to Topics.
