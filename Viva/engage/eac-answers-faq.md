# Answers in Viva Engage: Frequently asked questions

**What license is required to use Answers?**

You need a license to Viva Engage Knowledge service plan to use Answers. This service plan is available as part of _Viva Suite_ and _Employee Communications and Communities_.

**Can users who aren't assigned the Viva Engage Knowledge service plan use Answers?**

These users receive notifications to questions or answers where they're mentioned. They can view that question or answer but can't navigate the rest of the Answers experience.

**Where can I access resources for Answers adoption practices?**

See [Viva Engage Adoption](https://adoption.microsoft.com/yammer/).

**Are posted questions visible to everyone in my company?**

Answers are visible to anyone in your organization who has a Viva Suite license. Answers posts can be routed to anyone else in your organization who has a Microsoft 365 license, but those other employees can only access the individual thread, not other parts of Answers.

**Can admins disable the Answers Digest sent to their organization?**

Currently, admins can't configure or disable the automated Answers Digest emails from Answers in Viva.

**Is guest access permitted for Answers?**

Answers doesn't support guest access.

**Can our organization use Answers without Topics?**

Yes. Viva Topics are going away in 2025, which means that Viva Engage will return to a simplified topics experience in Answers. Associating a topic with your question simply helps to categorize it, which in turn, helps improve the Answers feed and digest. For more details, <<link to announcement when published>>.

**Why can’t users in my organization access Answers?**

Check that your Viva Engage network meets the [technical requirements](/viva/engage/eac-answers-overview-setup), and your users have the correct license to access Answers. Your Viva Engage network must be in Native mode and have legacy Viva Engage topics migrated to Topics.
