Advanced analytic capabilities in Viva Engage enables:

## Manage analytics

Any user with access to premium Viva Engage can access Engage Analytics. But only a Microsoft 365 Global administrator or Engage admin can manage settings through the [Viva Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac).

In the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu, and then select **Admin** to open the Viva Engage admin center.

 The global admin and Engage admin can configure, enable, and disable analytics features through the admin portal to tailor the experience for their organization: Go to the **Setup and configuration** tab in the Viva Engage admin center and select **Manage analytics**.

## Audience analytics  

In the **Manage analytics** interface shown earlier, the Engage admin can adjust the level of sentiment analysis that's available to leaders and their delegates through the **Audience analytics** dashboard. This functionality enables unique levels of sentiment collection at the audience, theme, or conversation level.

Audience analytics help leaders and delegates monitor engagement of their audience on Viva Engage. Access is through the analytics icon on the top navigation bar or through the leader's storyline page.

## Frequently asked questions

**How often is data refreshed and analytics updated?**

Analytics refresh every 24 hours. If you don’t see changes reflected immediately, check back the next day.

**Where can users access analytics?**

Select the analytics icon in the main Viva Engage navigation menu.

**Why can't my leader/delegate see audience analytics?**

To view audience analytics, a leader and their delegate must be licensed users.

**Who can view and manage network analytics?**

Access to the data in this dashboard is restricted to network admins and corporate communicators who have permissions to change settings through the Viva Engage admin center.

**What licensing requirements need to be met?**

Network analytics is only available to organizations with *Viva Suite* or *Employee Communications and Communities* licensed users. A network must have at least 50% of their users licensed for network analytics to calculate and be available in their network.

**How is sentiment analysis determined?**

Sentiment analysis is a Viva Engage premium feature that aggregates data across Viva Engage conversations to surface trends. To understand more, see [Sentiment and theme analysis in Viva Engage](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/sentiment-and-theme-analysis-in-viva-engage-065c3355-d156-4bf8-afdb-663b0724befd#ID0EBBJ=Themes)

**How is retention calculated?**

The Viva Engage employee retention metric in Network Analytics shows the difference in the 28-day employee retention rates of employees who do and don't use Viva Engage. For details, see [Viva Engage Employee Retention](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/viva-engage-employee-retention-eac2abc2-2732-4012-b64f-d471bb05b7ac).

**What admin controls are available? Can analytics features be turned off?**

Yes. We understand that some data collection, like sentiment analysis, is especially sensitive for certain regions. Analytics provides admin controls in the Viva Engage Admin center where network admins and corporate communicator roles can turn off analytics features.  

**How are most active communities across your audience defined?**

To appear in the bubble graph chart, a community must have at least 50 members with at least one actively engaged member (through reactions, replies, and posts). A community is considered active if at least 5% of group members have reacted or replied. A community is considered idle if less than 5% of group members have reacted or replied.
