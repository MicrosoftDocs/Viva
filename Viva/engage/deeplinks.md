# Deep linking into Viva Engage

Often, you'll want to create a deep link to the Viva Engage app in Microsoft Teams or an entity within Viva Engage, such as a community. For example, you want to include a link to a conversation a leader shared, a community that you're launching, or a campaign you're emailing about.

This article will discuss how you can manually construct different deep links into the Viva Engage app.

> [!TIP]
> While the `https://aka.ms/...` link is shorter, use the longer `https://teams.microsoft.com...` link if you're sharing the deep link in Teams. This way, it will link directly to the Viva Engage tab without opening a new browser window first.

## Deep link to the Viva Engage store entry
The following links open the Viva Engage store page in Microsoft Teams:
- https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/Install
- https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/db5e5970-212f-477f-a3fc-2227dc7782bf

## Deep link to Viva Engage directly
The following links currently open Yammer.com and will open Viva Engage in the browser [when the rebrand occurs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/yammer-is-evolving-to-viva-engage/ba-p/3738825). 
- https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/Web
- https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/Yammer

The following links directly open Viva Engage in Microsoft Teams. If the app isn't installed, the user will be prompted to do so.
- https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/Launch
- https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/db5e5970-212f-477f-a3fc-2227dc7782bf/vivaengage

The following link directly opens Viva Engage in Outlook, if available:
- https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/Outlook

## Deep link to Answers in Viva
The following link directly opens Viva Engage into Answers in Viva page.
- https://aka.ms/AnswersInViva
- https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/Answers
- https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/db5e5970-212f-477f-a3fc-2227dc7782bf/vivaengage?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3A%22type%3Dcustom%2Cdata%3Dquestionspage%3A_%22%7D


## Deep link to Leadership corner
In the browser (Yammer.com): 
- https://aka.ms/LeadershipCorner
- https://web.yammer.com/main/leadership-corner

In Teams:
- https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/LeadershipCorner
- https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/db5e5970-212f-477f-a3fc-2227dc7782bf/vivaengage?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22:%22type=custom,data=leadershipcorner:null%22%7D 

## Deep link to a Viva Engage entity
Links in these formats will open the entity in Viva Engage in Teams. 

- `https://aka.ms/VivaEngage/Launch?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22:%22type=custom,data=<EntityType>:<EntityId>%22%7D`
- `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/db5e5970-212f-477f-a3fc-2227dc7782bf/vivaengage?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22:%22type=custom,data=<EntityType>:<EntityId>%22%7D`

However, you will need to:
1. Replace _`<EntityType>`_ with one of the following values: 
   
   | Type      | Replace _`<EntityType>`_ with... |
   | --------- | ------------- |
   | Post      | `thread`  |
   | Community | `group`  |
   | Storyline | `user`  |
   | Campaign  | `campaign`  |
   <!-- | Leadership corner | `leadershipcorner`  | -->

2. Fill in the  _`<EntityId>`_. The easiest way is by going to the corresponding page on Yammer.com, and then pasting the last part of the URL. For example, for the storyline of `https://web.yammer.com/main/users/eyJfdHlwZSI6IlVzZXIiLCJpZCI6IjUwMzIxMDg3kyOCJ9`, replace _`<EntityId>`_  with `eyJfdHlwZSI6IlVzZXIiLCJpZCI6IjUwMzIxMDg3kyOCJ9`.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Don't omit the `%22%7D` at the end of the URLs.
