# Migrate your classic feeds with Embed Feed for Engage

**Embed Feed for Engage** lets you add Viva Engage feeds to your HTML-based applications by using iFrame widgets. This modern experience replaces classic Embed Feed, which used a JavaScript API to render the embed view.

>[!NOTE]
>Starting January 31, 2025, Microsoft will retire and no longer support classic Embed Feed. To avoid a broken feed experience, we recommend that you replace your classic embed feeds as soon as possible using the following instructions.

## Which version are you using?

To determine if your site uses classic Embed Feed, examine your feed's code structure:

- If your embed code uses a "yam" object (for example, "yam.connect.embedFeed" as in the following code example), it's using the classic Embed. Proceed to the next section to migrate your feed.

- If your embed code starts with "iframe", it's already using Embed Feed for Engage. No action is required.

## Replace your classic Embed feed

Follow these instructions to update your Embed feed experience. This process doesn’t affect Viva Engage data in any way.

1. Open the file that contains your embed feed.
1. Note any special configuration properties (such as, "footer:true").

1. In a new browser tab, go to the [Embed widget configuration site](https://engage.cloud.microsoft/embed/widget?domainRedirect=false) in Viva Engage.

1. From the left pane, select the type of feed you want to render in your new embed view. Note the following changes from the classic feed types:

    - **Home feed** replaces My feed.
    - **Community feed** replaces Group feed. For source, type the community name.
    - **Topic feed** requires a topic name for your feed.
    - **User feed** requires a user name associated with the feed.
    - **Web link feed** replaces Open Graph feed. Enter the source URL currently in use.

1. If needed, customize the configuration with properties you noted in step 2.
1. When you’re done, select **Get code**.

    The code for your iFrame widget appears on the main page.

1. Select **Copy**.

1. In the HTML code file you opened in step 1, select your previous classic embed feed and paste the new iFrame code in its place.
