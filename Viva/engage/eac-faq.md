# Viva Engage admin center: Frequently asked questions

**Who can access the Viva Engage admin center in the Viva Engage Teams application?**

The following roles can access the Viva Engage admin center: Global admin, Engage admin, Answers admin, corporate communicator, leader, and leader’s delegate manager.  

**Can every role that has access to the Viva Engage admin center perform all configurations in it?**

No, the configurations visible for each role in the Engage admin center depend on the administrative permissions for that role and the license held by the tenant. For example, a corporate communicator doesn't have access to governance and compliance-related settings. A corporate communicator can't create or manage campaigns if their tenant doesn't have a Viva Engage premium license.  

**How are the new Engage admin roles related to existing Yammer and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles?**

The following figure represents the link and hierarchy:

**Can I access the Yammer admin center for certain Engage admin configurations even if my organization doesn’t currently use Yammer?**

Yes, if you hold the following admin roles: Global admin and Engage admin. Because Viva Engage is powered by Yammer technology, you still use certain admin configurations in Yammer to set up Viva Engage for your organization. [Learn more about Yammer’s admin center](/Yammer/).

**When admin changes are made in Yammer, are they reflected in Viva Engage?**

Yes, because Viva Engage is powered through Yammer technology. Changes made in the Yammer admin center affect Viva Engage.
