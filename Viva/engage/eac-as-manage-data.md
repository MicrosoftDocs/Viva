# Manage data in the Viva Engage admin center

## Manage Data
As an Office 365 Global admin or Engage admin, you're encouraged to use Yammer administrative tools to protect your Viva Engage data and comply with legal and regulatory standards, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For access, an Engage admin goes to the **Governance and compliance** tab in the [Viva Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac) and selects **Data**.

They're then routed to the Yammer admin center, where they can perform the following actions:

- [Manage GDPR data subject requests](/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/gdpr-requests-in-yammer-enterprise)
    - Erase a user from the network
    - Reactivate a deactivated account after erasing the user

   >[!NOTE]
   > Because Viva Engage is powered by Yammer technology, removing a user from the network deletes the user in Yammer and Viva Engage.

- [Export data to review compliance issues](/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data)
    - Export data for one user
    - Export data for a network
    - Export users and admin list

   >[!NOTE]
   > Because Viva Engage is powered by Yammer technology, any data generated as part of Viva Engage or Answers in Viva feature is included in Yammer exports.
