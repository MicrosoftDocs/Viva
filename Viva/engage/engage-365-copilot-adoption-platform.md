# Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption community in Viva Engage

Network admins and corporate communicators can enable a Viva Engage community specifically built to support adoption of Microsoft 365 Copilot.
The **Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption community** makes it easier for users to ask questions, seek support from peers and IT admins, and learn best practices for Copilot.

Network admins and corporate communicators can access configuration settings through a discoverable banner in their home feed.

>[!NOTE]
>The **Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption community** is only available in Viva Engage tenants that have Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses through one of the following [service plans](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/microsoft-365-copilot): Microsoft Copilot with Graph-grounded chat, Microsoft 365 Copilot in Productivity App, or Microsoft 365 Copilot in Microsoft Teams.

## Configure your adoption community

You have two options for creating a Copilot adoption community in Viva Engage.

- Accept the configuration presets to **create a new community**. 
  The new community type includes onboarding prompts and a community template.

- Apply the adoption features to an **existing community**.
  This option adds new features (setup checklist, suggested members and content, top Q&A, and conversation starters) to your community without impacting existing content and customizations.

Setup is similar to creating any other community, only simpler. The templatized community removes much of the work for setup and ongoing community management. At completion, the community includes a cover photo, description, and onboarding checklist. Admins can add customizations as needed.

>[!NOTE]
> To create this community, Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses _must be present_ on the tenant. However, those licenses don't need to be assigned to the network admin or  corporate communicator who's setting up the community.

## Explore tools to build membership, content, and engagement

The Copilot community experience includes the following features to help drive engagement. After the community is set up, most features can be disabled as needed.  

- **Suggested content** offers a quick way to introduce Copilot capabilities and has various quick tips and tricks available for members. All content is editable prior to posting.
The suggested content here aligns with content you'll find in the Viva Amplify communications campaign, available through the Copilot Deployment Kit. [Learn more here.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-amplify-blog/announcing-the-copilot-deployment-kit-in-viva-amplify/ba-p/4110466)

    :::image type="content" source="../media/engage/admin/engage-copilot-adoption-sug-content.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows suggested content that is generated on the Copilot adoption community page=.":::

- **Conversation Starters** help drive engagement between community members. Conversation starters for this community can't be edited initially, but they can be turned off in the Community settings.

- **Copilot writing assistance** can help members write their posts. Availability for the Copilot writing assistant is controlled at the network level.

- **Top questions** shows users the most commonly-asked questions in the community. Top questions appear in the right sidebar for quick reference.

- **Membership suggestion** dynamically grows your community by suggesting new members as your organization allots or assigns Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses. This helps community admins bring the right people into the community to learn and share.

## Fuel your Copilot adoption community with information resources

To help the community grow, upskill, and share knowledge, the Copilot adoption community admin can upload FAQs and other informational documents into the community through the Answers Intelligent Importer. Intelligent Importer leverages AI to generate question-and-answer pairs from the imported content, which you can review, edit, and then post. Learn how to use [Intelligent Importer](/viva/engage/eac-answers-importer).
