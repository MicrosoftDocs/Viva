# Manage and set up campaigns in Viva Engage

Campaigns are an interactive way to drive employee engagement, with the power to build company culture, community, and belonging. Campaigns can be created, managed, and deleted by Microsoft 365 Global admin, Engage admin, and corporate communicators.

## Set up a campaign

Within the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu to expose the admin option. Select **Admin** to navigate to the [Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-as-access-eac).

Navigate to the campaign dashboard by selecting **Campaigns** from the **Feature management** tab.

The campaign dashboard provides a list of active, ended, and draft campaigns created for the organization. From this page, you can create and edit campaigns, or access campaign analytics for better understanding of the campaign's performance and engagement.

## Create a campaign

1. Select **Create campaign** from the top right corner of the campaign dashboard.
2. Fill in the fields according to your campaign goals and customize the theme color of the campaign hashtag.
    1. The **Campaign name** and **Campaign hashtag** are required to successfully create your campaign. The campaign name will only appear in the campaign management dashboard and the campaign hashtag will appear on the campaign landing page.
3. Select **Confirm** when your campaign is ready to enter the draft state.

Since campaign hashtags are used as the binding element for all campaign content, any posted content containing the campaign hashtag will populate to the campaign landing page and will be included in campaign analytics.

>[!NOTE]
> As a campaign manager, you can set the default publisher of your campaign to be a certain type of post (discussion, question, poll, or praise). The type you choose will automatically populate the default publisher when users post in the campaign landing page. For example: if you set your default publisher to Question, then a question format will automatically appear to the user as they post from the campaign landing page.

## Corporate communicator privileges

Corporate communicators can manage campaigns by:
- Publishing campaigns to be **Active** and visible to all users in the network
- Setting **Active** campaigns to **Ended** once a campaign is finished
- Re-publishing **Ended** campaigns to be **Active** again for reoccurring campaigns
- Deleting campaigns that are not relevant or were made by mistake
- Updating certain assets on a campaign page such as the:
    - Goal tracker
    - Cover photo
    - Pinned posts
    - Pinned resources and links
    - Theme color of the campaign hashtag
- View campaign analytics

## Publish or end a campaign

1. To publish a campaign, select the ellipses button from the campaign management dashboard or from the campaign landing page.
2. Select **Publish campaign** to make the campaign **Active**.

Once a campaign is published, it becomes **Active** in the campaign management dashboard and the campaign landing page will be visible to any Viva Engage licensed user who selects a post or comment with the verified campaign hashtag.

> [!NOTE]
> The three campaigns that populate to the **Top campaigns** module on the right side of your Home page are ordered based on number of followers. Once a campaign is followed, it will no longer be visible in the **Top campaigns** module and will be replaced with a new campaign.  

Once a campaign has ended, the follow button and default publisher on the campaign landing page will be disabled. However, people can still post in communities and storylines using the campaign hashtag and those posts will accumulate in the campaign landing page.

## Build campaign awareness  

Users can discover campaigns through posts containing the verified campaign hashtag or through the campaigns discovery modules throughout Viva Engage.

- **Verified campaign hashtag**
    - By selecting a post or comment that contains the verified campaign hashtag, users will be routed to the campaign landing page where they can follow the campaign.

> [!NOTE]
> To build campaign awareness and reach, campaign managers and leaders across the organization are encouraged to share as many posts as possible with the campaign hashtag to their storyline and in communities. The campaign link can also be shared through posts, emails, and Microsoft Teams chats for users to easily access the campaign landing page.

- **Campaigns modules**
    - **Top campaigns** module: On the right side of the Home feed, users will see an Top campaigns module with current campaigns to participate in and follow.
    - **Followed campaigns** module: After following a campaign, users will see a Followed campaigns module on the right side of their storyline.

> [!NOTE]
> Users can participate in any campaign from the Home feed, in a community, on a storyline, or from the campaign landing page by creating or commenting on a post using the campaign hashtag.

## Manage campaign analytics and engagement

Engage admin and corporate communicators have access to analytics that help monitor campaign engagement and improve future campaigns. Campaign analytics can be accessed directly from the analytics icon on the top navigation menu of Viva Engage, the campaign management dashboard, and the campaign landing page.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I create a campaign for a hashtag already in use?** If the hashtag is being used by another campaign, then it cannot be used again. If, however, the hashtag has not been made into a campaign, then it can be used, but the content created before the Campaign is **Active** will not be included in views or analytics.

**How often do campaign analytics refresh?** Analytics refresh daily. If you don’t see changes reflected immediately, check analytics the next day.
