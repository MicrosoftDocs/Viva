# Viva Engage and Microsoft Defender XDR 

Microsoft Defender XDR is a comprehensive software as a service (SaaS) solution that brings enhanced threat protection to Microsoft Cloud Apps.  When your admin enables Defender in your Microsoft 365 network, all user-generated navigation activity funnels through the Defender service. The service prevents encounters with potential threats and provides visibility into Cloud App usage.

Defender works with Viva Engage the way you’d expect it to work with other cloud apps. Selecting a link in the Viva Engage app or system-generated email (such as Viva Engage notifications or digests) safely routes you to your intended destination as soon as Defender verifies the link.

If Defender can’t verify the link, it notifies you of the danger and routes you to safety. For more information, see [What is Microsoft Defender XDR?](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender?view=o365-worldwide&branch=live&preserve-view=true)
