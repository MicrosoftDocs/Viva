# Manage administrator roles in Viva Engage

To perform administrative tasks and facilitate many of the premium features in Viva Engage, users need to be assigned specific roles. The table below describes each of the admin roles in Viva Engage and the business functions they enable.

>[!NOTE]
>A Viva Engage license isn't required for an admin to configure Viva Engage (core or premium).
Unlike Viva Engage users, Microsoft 365 Global administrators and Engage administrators are exempt from needing a Viva Engage Core or premium license to access the [Engage website](https://engage.cloud.microsoft), the Engage Admin center, or legacy network admin center.
Other Viva Engage admin roles can also administer premium features without being assigned a premium license.
