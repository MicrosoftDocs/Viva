# Key admin roles and permissions in Viva Engage

The following roles have access to the Viva Engage admin center in the Viva Engage app:  

- Microsoft 365 Global admin
- Engage admin  
- Answers admin  
- Corporate communicator

## Microsoft 365 Global admin

The Microsoft 365 Global admin has unlimited access to the organization’s settings and most of its data. Naturally, the Global admin controls configuration for Viva Engage in your organization. To learn more about this role and security guidelines for assigning it, see [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

## Engage admin  

The Engage admin can set up and configure Engage for your organization. They also manage data, network related settings, and the various core and premium features in the application. This role is assigned when you [add Yammer administrators in Azure Active Directory](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/the-new-yammer-administrator-role-is-now-available-in-azure/ba-p/3592577). Yammer Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrators automatically become Engage admins and have elevated permissions over end users. This connection exists because Viva Engage is powered by Yammer technology.

>[!NOTE]
> This admin role is assigned and modified by a Global admin through Azure AD, [PIM](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure), [group based role assignments](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-concept), or [Azure portal and PowerShell](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal).

**Permissions**

The following table shows the range of actions available to Engage and Global admins based on their license. Admin permissions depend on those users having the right licensing to configure the features.

## Answers admin  

The Answers admin can set up and configure Answers in Viva Engage. Only a Global admin can assign or modify this role. It's assigned when you [add knowledge managers in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Froles%2Fcontext%2Fugr-context). All knowledge managers become Answers admins. They have elevated permissions over end users. The link between the Answers admin and the Knowledge Manager Azure AD role fits because Answers is best experienced when integrated with topics.  

**Permissions**

The following table shows the actions available to an unlicensed user, Viva Topics licensed user, Answers admin (knowledge manager), Engage (Yammer) admin, and Global admin.

## Corporate communicator

Corporate communicators can create and manage campaigns, define leaders, and more in Viva Engage. This role was created to address the need for content management in the organization, beyond being attached to a community, as a Community admin, but not as powerful as the overall Engage admin. Only the following roles can assign, modify, or deleted Corporate communicators privileges for users: Global admin, Engage admin, and fellow corporate communicators.

**Permissions**

The following table shows the actions available to a corporate communicator, Engage (Yammer) admin, and Global admin based on their license.
