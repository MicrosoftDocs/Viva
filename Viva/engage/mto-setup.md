# Set up Viva Engage for a multitenant organization

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Multitenant organization is available for Viva Engage on a cohort-based rollout. To configure this feature for your organization, contact your Microsoft Account Manager or Support.

Multitenant organization is a Microsoft 365 feature that allows complex and distributed organizations to communicate as a unified network. By configuring a tenant group in Microsoft 365 of trusted tenants in your organization, cross-tenant engagement is possible in Viva Engage. Learn more about [multitenant organizations](/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/).

#### Tenants connect in hub-and-spoke model

Viva Engage uses a hub-and-spoke model to communicate across tenants. The *hub* rests at the center and is the tenant that generates most of the organization's content. The hub should be the tenant where your identified leaders (for example, corporate communicators, HR, and policy makers) reside.

*Spoke* tenants are the remaining networks. By using storyline and Leadership corner, leaders on the hub can broadcast content to all spoke tenants simultaneously, ensuring that information is distributed in a timely and efficient manner.

After the hub tenant is configured for multitenant organization, all tenants can communicate as a single, unified network.  

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Engage Storyline, Leadership corner, and campaigns are available for cross-tenant engagement in a multitenant organization. More features will be added soon.

## Requirements

To access the multiple tenant organization feature for Viva Engage, your organization must meet these requirements across all tenants.

**Microsoft 365 requirements**

- An Entra P1 or P2 license, which is included in Microsoft 365 E3 or E5, and Microsoft 365 F1 or F3 SKUs
- Microsoft Entra ID manages all networks
- Microsoft Graph API

**Viva Engage requirements**

- Internal communications or IT manages Viva Engage
- Networks are in Native Mode
- Networks are not in a one-to-many state. Each tenant can have only one Viva Engage network. See [Network migration - Consolidate multiple Viva Engage networks](/viva/engage/configure-your-viva-engage-network/consolidate-multiple-networks).
- Full trust is established between all tenants. To establish full trust, [configure your organizational settings](/training/modules/secure-b2b-collaboration-cross-tenant-access/4-exercise-configure-organizational-settings).
- All users in both hub and spoke tenants are assigned a *Microsoft Viva Suite* or *Communications and Communities* license
- Storyline is enabled on the hub tenant. Refer to [instructions in this article](/Viva/engage/mto-setup#configure-the-hub-tenant-for-storyline) after the multitenant organization is set up.

## Prepare to set up a multitenant organization

Complete these tasks in the order they appear. Since the role requirement varies by task, it's called out in each section.

*For Microsoft 365 Global administrators*

This task assumes that all requirements for Microsoft 365 and Viva Engage are met.
When designing an effective multitenant organization, it’s crucial to establish a hub within the tenant where most essential communication originates. Leaders, corporate communicators, human resources, and policy makers drive most of the messaging for the organization. Therefore, these roles need to be in the hub tenant. Multitenant organization controls are available only to users internal to the hub tenant.

|Task description|Instructions|
|----------------|----------------|
|A. Plan out your multitenant organization.|See [Plan for multitenant organizations](/microsoft-365/enterprise/plan-multi-tenant-org-overview).|
|B. Determine the network configuration model for your organization.<br><br><br><br><br><br>|<ol><li>List all Microsoft Entra ID managed tenants in the organization.</li><li> Of the tenants in your organization, decide which one is the hub. Other tenants are considered spoke tenants.</li><li> For each spoke tenant, clarify the scope of users to synchronize to the hub tenant. How you [configure multitenant organization in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/) affects which users are able to participate in each tenant.</li>|
|C. Designate an Engage or network administrator on the hub tenant to configure the multitenant organization.|If you need a new admin role, see [Assign admin roles in Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles) or with [PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/assign-roles-to-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell).|

## Configure the multitenant organization in Microsoft 365

*For Microsoft 365 Global administrators*

Configuring the multitenant organization in Microsoft 365 requires Microsoft Graph API, which has its own [requirements and prerequisites](/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/multi-tenant-organization-overview). Learn more about the[Microsoft Graph API](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/support-tip-getting-started-with-microsoft-graph-api/ba-p/364257).

|Task description|Instructions|
|----------------|----------------|
|A. Configure the multitenant organization and participating tenants in the Microsoft 365 admin center.|<ol><li>Sign into the owner tenant and create a multitenant organization.</li><li>Add all tenants to the multitenant organization. See [Configure a multitenant organization using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/use-the-api)|
|B.	Generate the multitenant organization trust policy. Configure the policy template to correspond to partner configurations.| Configure a policy from [these templates](/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/multi-tenant-organization-configure-templates). |
|C. Synchronize across the multitenant organization.|See [Configure cross-tenant synchronization](/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure).|
|D. If you run into problems, troubleshoot the issue.|See [Known issues for multitenant organizations](/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/multi-tenant-organization-known-issues).|

## Configure Viva Engage for multitenant organization

*For Microsoft 365 Global administrators*

After you establish the multitenant organization in Microsoft 365, configure multitenant organization controls for Viva Engage on the tenant you've designated as the hub.
> [!NOTE]
> Licensing and other tenant-specific controls remain under control of that tenant’s admin. Hub users do not need a duplicate license in the spoke tenants, and spoke users do not need a duplicate license in the hub tenant.

|On the designated hub tenant, configure Viva Engage to recognize the tenant as the hub.|<ol><li>In the Viva Engage Teams application, select the ellipses button from the top navigation menu and select **Admin**.</li><li>On the **Feature management** tab,  select the **MTO policy** tile.</li><li>Select the hub tenant.</li>|

## Configure the hub tenant for Storyline

*For the Engage or network admin on the hub tenant*

From the hub tenant, configure Storyline settings to make announcements and leadership posts available across all tenants.
