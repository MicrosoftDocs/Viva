# Plan your Viva Engage launch strategy

Before you launch Viva Engage, create a strong and clear strategy to help users understand how Viva Engage facilitates connection and productivity within their organization.

### Primary goals of Viva Engage

As you create your strategy, keep in mind these two goals:

- Drive employee engagement

- Transform the business

### Create a vision statement

To help you write your vision statement, consider these questions:

- What are your organization’s core values?

- How will Viva Engage benefit the organization?

- What are your organization’s top initiatives for this fiscal year?

### Gather key stakeholders

Make sure you have the right people helping launch your tenant. Depending on your organization, these stakeholders could be project managers, IT specialists, or executive sponsors. This team will help establish expectations, create excitement, and communicate important details for the roll out.

### Build a launch plan

Your launch can coincide with the release of a new product or with the announcement of a new executive leader. No matter how you plan your launch, organizing key events and communications will help your tenant be a success.
