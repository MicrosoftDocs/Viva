# Viva Engage Basic networks are retired - FAQ

Starting December 1, 2022, we retired our free Microsoft Yammer Basic networks to ensure smoother integration and new functionality for our Microsoft Viva Engage customers. This decision was initially announced in June 2022. Loss of basic or "freemium" network access was enforced in May 2023.

#### We still want a Viva Engage network. What can we do?

If your organization has a Microsoft 365 license, Viva Engage is included. See [Manage Viva Engage domains in Microsoft 365](../configure-your-viva-engage-network/manage-viva-engage-domains.md). If your organization doesn't have a license, [subscriptions are available](
https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compare-microsoft-365-enterprise-plans?rtc=1) starting at $8 month per user.

#### My organization has a Viva Engage network, but users from basic networks collaborate with us. Can they join our network as guests?

Not unless they upgrade their license. If you're based in the US, you can invite them to collaborate with you through an [external network](../work-with-external-users/create-and-manage-an-external-network.md).

#### Our collaborators no longer have access to our external network as guests. How can they regain access?

It sounds like your collaborators have basic accounts, which are now retired. If your Viva Engage networks are hosted in the US, you can invite guests to your external network. If you run your tenant in Native Mode, you can invite guests to individual communities. Before guests can join your external network or communities, however, they must upgrade their license. Ask your collaborators to contact their organization’s network administrator.  

#### What if we want to keep all our data from the old network and move it to the new network?

This is no longer possible as access to these networks has been disabled.

#### I don't have an enterprise network provisioned yet. Can I just add my basic network domain to Microsoft 365 to upgrade in place?

No. Adding your basic network domain to Microsoft 365 deletes the contents of your basic network. [Export your basic network data](../eac-as-manage-data.md) first.

#### We're a nonprofit organization that relies on a free version. What can we do?

Microsoft offers special pricing for legally registered nonprofit organizations around the world. Learn more about [eligibility](https://www.microsoft.com/nonprofits/eligibility?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr4).

#### What if we just want to export our data from the basic network?

This is no longer possible as access to these networks has been disabled.
