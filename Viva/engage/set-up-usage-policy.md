# Set up a Viva Engage usage policy

Creating a usage policy that users are required to accept can help ensure conversations on Viva Engage are positive, constructive, and in line with your company policies and culture. 
  
You can choose to have a link to the usage policy in the side bar in each user's Viva Engage home screen, and to display the policy as a pop-up that users must accept before entering the network.
  
![The usage policy is displayed on the right sidebar.](../media/set-up-usage-policy-message.png)
  
## Set up or modify a Viva Engage usage policy

1. To create or modify your usage policy and its settings, navigate to the  Engage admin center. Select **Configure Tenant** under the **Setup & configuration** tab. This will redirect you to the Yammer admin center, where you can select **Usage Policy**.

2. Select when users should see the policy, and whether to display the reminder in the sidebar.

3. Enter your usage policy title and sidebar message.

4. Enter your usage policy text. You can use HTML code to format your usage policy. Basic HTML tags including links and basic formatting are allowed within the usage policy. JavaScript is not allowed.

    > [!TIP]
    > Use the [Sample Viva Engage usage policy](set-up-usage-policy.md#SampleUsePolicy) for ideas of what to include.
  
## Tips for creating your usage policy

For best results, we recommend that your usage policy:
  
- Is primarily positive and explanatory (and not just a list of "don'ts").

- Encourages usage by providing positive examples and suggestions.

- Requires that content be office‐appropriate.

- Includes a link for reporting inappropriate content.

You can include HTML links to relevant company policy information and to Viva Engage training resources.
  
## Sample Viva Engage usage policy 

Here's a sample usage policy for you to start with.

## Set up an Engage browser policy

You can add a custom link to your organization's browser policy. The link will be included in the banner that is automatically displayed for some obsolete browsers. Your organization's browser policy might include information such as restrictions on which current browser to use and where to get a current browser.
  
 For example, if the admin specifies the URL for the browser policy as http&#58;//www&#46;contoso&#46;com/IT/browserpolicy&#46;htm, this is what the user will see at the top of the page when they use an old browser:

## Add a link to your organization's browser policy
  
1. In the Viva Engage admin center, Engage admin center, select **Configure Tenant** under the **Setup & configuration** tab. This will redirect you to the Yammer admin center, where you can select **Usage Policy**. Then select **Set a custom browser policy URL within your company**.
