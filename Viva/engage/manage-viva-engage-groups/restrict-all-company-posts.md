# Restrict All Company posts in Viva Engage

Organizations that want to drive the conversation in the Viva Engage All Company community can now restrict posting.

Restricted posting applies only to All Company communities and is supported with the Microsoft Teams Communities app integration and the Microsoft Outlook integration. 

Only All Company admins can restrict All Company posts.

1. In **All Company**, select the **More options** icon, and then select **Settings**.

1. Under **Posting Permissions**, select **Restricted: Only admins can start a conversation in this community**. All members can comment and reply to a comment.

After you've selected this option, users won't see the option to post in All Company.

>[!NOTE]
>If you run a live event in a post-restricted All Company community, questions and comments from the live event will appear in the community feed. (Live events are only available in Microsoft 365 connected All Company communities.) For more information about how connected groups work, see [Viva Engage and Microsoft 365 Groups](/viva/engage/engage-microsoft-365-groups).

## What employees see in All Company

When All Company is set to **Restricted**, users can't post conversation starters in All Company. They either see that All Company is Restricted or that 'Only admins can start a conversation.'

- All employees can respond to conversation starters and reactions.

- Users can reply to posts by using Outlook, but can't post. Only All Company admins can post through email.

## Restricting posting in an embedded feed

Restricting posts in All Company is supported with the SharePoint Conversations V2 web part. No other web parts or embed features supports post restriction in All Company.

For details about the SharePoint Conversations V2 web part, see [Use a Viva Engage web part in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-a-viva-engage-web-part-in-sharepoint-a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da).
