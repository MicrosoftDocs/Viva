# Answers admin scenarios in Viva

Administration of Answers is for the Microsoft 365 Global admin, the Engage admin, and the new role of *Answers admin*. The new role of Answers admin is designated by [adding Knowledge Managers in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Froles%2Fcontext%2Fugr-context). All Knowledge managers become Answers admins and have elevated permissions over end users. To better align the experiences of Viva Topics management and Answers administration, you can assign the same users that manage Viva Topics to manage Answers. For more information, see:
- [Assign a role to a group using Privileged Identity Management](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-pim-eligible)
- [Creating a role-assignable group in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-create-eligible)  

## Permissions

The following table shows the actions available to users and admins.

## Manage topics in Answers

### **Feature topics in Answers**

As an Answers admin, you can feature a topic or create a topic from the topic browse page. When you feature topics, you curate Viva Topics to be promoted for use in Answers.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Feature a topic** button is only visible to the Answers admin or Global admin.  

[![Screenshot of the Discover more Topics interface in Viva Engage.](/viva/media/engage/admin/feature-a-topic.png)](/viva/media/engage/admin/feature-a-topic.png#lightbox)

1. When you start to type the topic you want to feature, existing Viva Topics appear, and you can choose one to feature.

2. After you select a topic to feature, you can edit the summary field that will be displayed as the short description of that topic in Answers. The summary helps people understand the topic and whether it’s the appropriate topic to attach to their questions.

>[!NOTE]
> The title and summary of all Viva Topics that are featured in Answers are visible to all licensed users who have access to Answers.

### **Review pending topics suggested by employees**

To ensure that topics suggested by employees are relevant and appropriate, there's a review process for Answers admins to follow. Answers admins have a  **Needs Review** tab on the topic browse page, which is only visible to them. It displays user-created or suggested topics. Any nonfeatured topic that's added to a question or created by the user appears on this tab for a knowledge manager to review. Select **Review** on a topic to check and edit the summary.

[![Screenshot of the topics that need review in Answers in Viva.](/viva/media/engage/admin/needs-review-topic.png)](/viva/media/engage/admin/needs-review-topic.png#lightbox)

You have options to feature or ignore the topic, which removes it from the Review tab:  

- **Ignore**: When you ignore a topic, it remains visible with the questions that it's been used with. But it won't get featured, which makes topics more prominent in the publisher’s topic picker.  
- **Feature**: When topics are featured, they no longer appear in the **Needs Review** tab.

**Remove topics in Answers**

To remove a topic in Answers, Answers admins (knowledge managers) follow these steps:  

1. Go to the browse topics page in Answers.
2. Select the ellipsis button on a topic, which prompts you to remove the topic in Answers.

3. When a topic is removed, it disappears from Answers and is no longer associated with any questions where it was previously used.

>[!NOTE]
> After a topic is removed in Answers, you can still see the topic in the topic center. To remove the topic entirely, you must delete it directly in the topic center.

## View Global Answers analytics

As an Answers admin, you can access Global Answers analytics:
1. Select the analytics icon from the top navigation bar of Viva Engage.
1. Go to the Global Answers analytics tab. You'll see an analytics dashboard that provide an overview and relevant insights about knowledge sharing activity across Answers in Viva.

For more details about how to manage analytics in the [Viva Engage admin center](/Viva/engage/eac-overview), see [View and manage analytics in Viva Engage](/Viva/engage/analytics) .

- **Total questions**: Number of questions asked by users.
- **Question views**: Views across all questions
- **Total answers**: Number of answers provided by users.
- **Total best answers**: Answers marked as best answer.
- **Answer rate**: The ratio of questions that have answers to total questions.
- **Best answer rate**: The ratio of questions with best answers to total questions.
- **Median time to first answer**: The median time it takes for a question to receive its first answer.
- **Median time to best answer**: The median time it takes for a question to receive its first best answer.
- **Median questions asked per user**: The median number of questions asked by each user.
- **Median questions viewed per user**: The median number of questions viewed by each user.
- **Median answers per user**: The median number of answers provided by each user.

- **User engagement distribution**: A distribution of all users split by active engagements (ask, answer, vote, reactions, comments) and passive engagements (question views).

**Global time saved** shows the time saved across the organization. This total is based on Yammer research that shows that each question-and-answer pair saves people an average of 15 minutes. As more people discover existing answers to their questions, the organization saves more time.
