# Administrator scenarios for Answers in Viva Engage

Administration of Answers requires either an Engage admin or Answers admin role.

>[!NOTE]
>The Microsoft 365 Global administrator can designate an Answers admin by [adding a Knowledge manager in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Froles%2Fcontext%2Fugr-context). Knowledge managers become Answers admins and have elevated permissions over end users. To better align the experiences of Topics management and Answers administration, you can assign the same users that manage Topics to manage Answers. For more information, see:

- [Assign a role to a group using Privileged Identity Management](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-pim-eligible)
- [Creating a role-assignable group in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-create-eligible)  

## Permissions

The following table shows the actions available to users and admins.

## Update information panel

### Provide guidance using the information panel

The Answers admin or Engage admin can use the information panel to provide guidance to employees on how to use Answers within the organization. The information panel is only visible to administrators in its default state. After an admin saves and publishes the information panel, all other employees with access to Answers can see the information panel.

## Manage topics in Answers

### Feature topics in Answers

As an Answers admin, you can feature a topic or create a topic from the topic browse page. When you feature topics, you curate Topics to be promoted for use in Answers.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Feature a topic** button is only visible to the Answers admin.  

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the Discover more Topics interface in Viva Engage." source="/viva/media/engage/admin/feature-a-topic.png" lightbox="/viva/media/engage/admin/feature-a-topic.png":::

1. When you start to type the topic you want to feature, existing Topics appear, and you can choose one to feature.  

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot  of the editable summary for your topic in Viva Engage." source="/viva/media/engage/admin/type-topic.png" lightbox="/viva/media/engage/admin/type-topic.png":::

2. After you select a topic to feature, you can edit the summary field that will be displayed as the short description of that topic in Answers. The summary helps people understand the topic and whether it’s the appropriate topic to attach to their questions.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the editable summary for your topic in Viva Engage." source="/viva/media/engage/admin/edit-topic-summary.png" lightbox="/viva/media/engage/admin/edit-topic-summary.png":::

>[!NOTE]
> The title and summary of all Topics featured in Answers are visible to all licensed users who have access to Answers.

### Review pending topics suggested by employees

To ensure that topics suggested by employees are relevant and appropriate, there's a review process for Answers admins to follow. Answers admins have a **Needs Review** tab on the topic browse page, which is only visible to them. The tab displays user-created or suggested topics. Any nonfeatured topic that's added to a question or created by the user appears on this tab for a knowledge manager to review. Select **Review** on a topic to check and edit the summary.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the topics that need review in Answers in Viva." source="/viva/media/engage/admin/needs-review-topic.png" lightbox="/viva/media/engage/admin/needs-review-topic.png":::

You have options to feature or ignore the topic, which removes it from the **Review** tab:  

- **Ignore**: When you ignore a topic, it remains visible with the questions that it's been used with. But it won't get featured, which makes topics more prominent in the publisher’s topic picker.  
- **Feature**: When topics are featured, they no longer appear in the **Needs Review** tab.

:::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the interface for reviewing a topic in Answers in Viva." source="/viva/media/engage/admin/feature-reviewed-topic.png" lightbox="/viva/media/engage/admin/feature-reviewed-topic.png":::

**Remove topics in Answers**

To remove a topic in Answers, Answers admins (knowledge managers) follow these steps:  

1. Go to the browse topics page in Answers.
2. Select the ellipsis button on a topic, which prompts you to remove the topic in Answers.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the Remove a topic button that admins see in the topic browse page in Answers in Viva." source="/viva/media/engage/admin/remove-topic-hover.png" lightbox="/viva/media/engage/admin/remove-topic-hover.png":::


3. When a topic is removed, it disappears from Answers and is no longer associated with any questions where it was previously used.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot of the interface and confirmation screen to remove a topic in Answers in Viva." source="/viva/media/engage/admin/confirm-remove-topic.png" lightbox="/viva/media/engage/admin/confirm-remove-topic.png":::


>[!NOTE]
> After a topic is removed in Answers, you can still see the topic in the topic center. To remove the topic entirely, you must delete it directly in the topic center.

## View Global Answers analytics

As an Answers admin, you can access Global Answers analytics:
1. Select the analytics icon from the top navigation bar of Viva Engage.
1. Go to the **Global Answers analytics** tab. The analytics dashboard provides an overview and relevant insights about knowledge sharing activity across Answers in Viva.
