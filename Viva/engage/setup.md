# Setting up Viva Engage

## Set up licensing for Viva Engage

If a user is enabled for Yammer, they're also enabled to use Viva Engage. Viva Engage is included as a part of the existing Yammer license. This is unchanged from the Yammer Communities app for Microsoft Teams that Viva Engage replaces. For details, see [Manage Viva Engage licenses in Microsoft 365](/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365.md).

## Configure and review privacy and security settings

The Yammer administrator can manage the content in Yammer and Viva Engage. Privacy and security controls from Yammer are shared with Viva Engage.
For details, see [Overview of security & compliance for Yammer](/viva/engage/manage-security-and-compliance/security-and-compliance).

## Installing Viva Engage

### Install the Viva Engage app for yourself in Teams 

 1. Open Teams on the web or in a desktop client.

 2. From the left side of Teams, select **Apps**.

 3. Search for **Viva Engage**.

 4. Select the **Viva Engage** app, and then select **Add**. This adds the app to all your Teams clients, including mobile.

 **Note**: If you don't see **Viva Engage** in the available apps, check with your Teams admin. They might have renamed the app. 
 
 ### Install the Viva Engage app for your organization

The Microsoft Teams admin can choose to deploy and pin the app for all users or for particular departments through a [Teams app setup policy](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

 ## Customize the appearance for Viva Engage in the Teams store

 You can customize the appearance for the following properties of the Viva Engage app in the Teams app store:
 - app name
 - app description 
 - app icons
 - accent color

Customizing the Viva Engage app is perfect for companies that have given their network custom branding to fit their corporate identity.

**Note:** Currently, this won't affect the Viva Engage app branding shown in the app _within_ the Viva Engage Experience.
