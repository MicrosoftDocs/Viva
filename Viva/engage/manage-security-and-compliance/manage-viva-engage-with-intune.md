# Manage Viva Engage on mobile devices with Microsoft Intune

When you subscribe to [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/endpoint-management/microsoft-intune?rtc=1), you can use mobile application management (MAM) with Viva Engage along with other apps. MAM allows you to manage and protect data in an app on a device even if it is not enrolled in mobile device management (MDM).
  
## Manage Viva Engage with MAM

Microsoft Intune provides mobile application management (MAM) capabilities for Viva Engage, Outlook, and other Microsoft mobile apps for iOS and Android.
  
This feature is especially helpful for organizations where devices and apps are used for both work and personal use and the device is not enrolled in MDM. When using Viva Engage with Intune, you can set up policies that apply to the Viva Engage app on Android and iOS devices to help protect your corporate data. For example, you can do the following:
  
| Intune policy you can enforce on the app | Available for Android? | Available for iOS? |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Allow apps to transfer data to other apps.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Allow apps to receive data from other apps.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Prevent "Save As".  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Prevent iTunes and iCloud backups.  |No  |Yes  |

|Restrict web content to display in the Intune Managed Browser.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Encrypt app data.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Disable contacts sync.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Require PIN for access, and set specific requirements such as PIN length and number of allowed tries.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Allow use of fingerprint instead of PIN.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Require corporate credentials for access.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Block managed apps from running on jailbroken or rooted devices.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|The frequency of how often the access requirements are checked.  |Yes  |Yes  |
|Block screen capture and Android Assistant.  |Yes  |No  |
|When you retire or un-enroll a device with the Viva Engage app, the application's corporate data are deleted.  |Yes  |Yes  |
