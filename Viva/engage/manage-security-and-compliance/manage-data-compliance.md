# Manage Viva Engage data compliance

As a Viva Engage admin, you can keep your users' Viva Engage posts appropriate and meet security and compliance requirements. You can set up alerts for content that matches keywords, set data retention policies, and if needed, you can view private content. You can also [export data from Viva Engage](export-viva-engage-enterprise-data.md).

<a name="MonitorKeywords"> </a> 
## Monitor Keywords

Monitor sensitive content by specifying keywords such as banned words or employees' personal information. All messages in internal and external networks, including messages to and from external participants can be monitored.
  
 **Set person responsible for monitoring, editing, and deleting flagged posts**
  
1. In the Viva Engage admin center, go to **Content and security** > **Monitor Keywords**, and enter the person's email address in **Email Address**. This person should be a verified admin so they have permission to delete messages anywhere in Viva Engage.
    
2. When a post matches a keyword, the person listed in **Email Address** receives an email. They can then select a link in the email to review, edit, or delete the flagged post. 
    
 **Specify keywords and phrases to monitor**
  
1. In the Viva Engage admin center, go to **Content and Security** \> **Monitor Keywords**.
    
2. Enter the words and phrases you want to monitor, each on its own line.
    
    You can use regular expressions to match patterns. For information on using regular expressions, see [Regular Expression Language](/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference).
    
    Here are some examples of regular expressions commonly used for monitoring.
    
|**Purpose**|**Pattern**|**Matches**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Word boundary |\bword\b |\btheme\b matches "theme" but not "themes" or "them" |
|Credit cards |\b(?:\d[ ‐]\*?){13,16}\b |1234 5678 90123  <br/> 1234 5678 9012 3456  <br/> 1234‐5678‐9012‐3456 |

## Data retention

You can remove deleted data from the user's view, while preserving it for data export for the life of the tenant.

1. In the Viva Engage admin center, go to **Content and Security** > **Data Retention**.
1. Select **Archive** and save your changes.
    <br> This setting applies to your entire network.

**To hard-delete deleted data**, use the [GDPR workflow](gdpr-requests-in-viva-engage-enterprise.md) or the hard-delete API. Files uploaded through Engage and hosted in other Microsoft 365 resources (for example, SharePoint) are subject to the deletion policies of the hosting resource.

**To permanently delete retained data in Viva Engage storage**, [export the data](../eac-as-manage-data.md) to identify the data you need to delete permanently and then write a custom PowerShell script to loop through the specific items to delete using the [REST API](/rest/api/yammer/rest-api-rate-limits).

**To permanently delete retained Viva Engage files saved in SharePoint**, you must use data retention settings in Microsoft Office 365. For more information, see [Overview of retention policies](/office365/securitycompliance/retention-policies).

## Content mode

If as a verified Viva Engage admin, you have a legal reason to view private messages, you can select to see them. For more information, see [Monitor private content in Viva Engage](monitor-private-content.md).
