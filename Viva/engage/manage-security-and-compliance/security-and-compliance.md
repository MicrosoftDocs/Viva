## Security FAQ

### Q: Who can access the Viva Engage network?

A: Only users with a valid and verified company email address can join your Viva Engage network. Viva Engage has functionality to create external networks to collaborate securely with third parties.

### Q: What endpoints need to be reachable for Viva Engage users?

A: As of January 2024, all Viva Engage users need to be able to access
**engage.cloud.microsoft**. We recommend against using a list of IP address ranges to control access since they can change and create access problems for users.

For complete Microsoft 365 URL and IP address ranges info, see [Microsoft 365 endpoints](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-endpoints).

### Q: Where is the data hosted?

A: Viva Engage data is hosted in Microsoft managed datacenters. See [Where is your data located](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations) to find the data centers for the country in which your company is located. Viva Engage operates out of Microsoft's global network of data centers. These centers have 24/7/365 video surveillance, biometric and pin-based locks, strict personnel access controls and detailed visitor-entry logs.

For more information, see [Viva Engage data residency](data-residency.md).

### Q: What's the Viva Engage privacy policy? How do you treat my data?

A: Our privacy policy is publicly shared and available here, as part of the: [Microsoft Online Services Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=331314).

### Q: What is the Viva Engage security policy?
<a name="SecurityPolicy"> </a>

A: Viva Engage is included in the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083681).

### Q: Who has access to the data?

A: Only employees with a legitimate business need can access customer data, and all access is on an approval‚Äêonly basis. All access is logged and regularly audited.

### Q: Is the data encrypted?
<a name="Encryption"> </a>

A: All data in transit into and out of the production environment is always encrypted. Communication with Viva Engage is over HTTPS (TLS 1.2 supported) regardless of user endpoint (web, desktop app, mobile app, API). In addition to being encrypted in transit, Viva Engage data is encrypted at rest with AES-256 bit key encryption.

Current versions of the Viva Engage iOS and Android mobile apps use Apple and Google services for final delivery to end user devices. To ensure confidentiality of information between the Viva Engage service and the device, we use Push Notification Encryption to protect notifications in transit. Encrypted notifications are available for the Viva Engage iOS mobile app version 7.36.0 or later. They're also available for the Viva Engage Android mobile app version 5.6.5 or later.

### Q: What is Viva Engage's architecture?

A: The architecture is driven by the needs of an Enterprise Social Network (ESN). An ESN is successful only if users adopt and engage with the platform. As such, Viva Engage is architected and developed in a way to support adoption and engagement, allowing rapid iterations of technology.

Viva Engage is a set of loose components, coupled with APIs. These are developed and released independently using many different best-in-class codes and technologies. Viva Engage is a public cloud, SaaS, multitenant architecture only. We use a data-driven, rapidly iterating development approach to measure the success of the platform using the key metrics of end-user engagement and adoption.

### Q: Who owns the data posted in the Viva Engage network?

A: Data posted into a Viva Engage Basic network is owned by the individuals posting that data. Those users are the data controllers for their content. Under Viva Engage Enterprise, the company is the data controller, and ownership of all data transfers to the company. Viva Engage is a data processor and has no rights to any content or responsibilities for the data posted within a Viva Engage network.

### Q: Do you comply with the data protection act in my country?

A: It's the data controller's responsibility to comply with the data protection legislation that affects them. Viva Engage has controls in place to facilitate data controllers' (individuals and companies) compliance with their data protection legislation.

### Q: Can we perform an on‚Äêsite visit or audit of your facilities?

A: Viva Engage doesn't permit customers to perform on‚Äêsite audits. With over 200,000 customers, audits aren't feasible. It's also a risk to the security of the service. We'll answer any security questions openly and transparently.

### Q: Do you conduct third‚Äêparty audits or testing?

A: Penetration tests of the Viva Engage infrastructure are conducted yearly as part of Microsoft 365.

### Q: How is data separated from other customers?

A: Viva Engage is a true multi-tenant model. As such, customers' data is logically separated with strict controls to ensure separation of tenant data. The web application servers of Viva Engage are physically and logically separated from servers that store customer data.

### Q: What is the difference between the security of an enterprise social network and Facebook?

A: Your Viva Engage network is private to your company. Only users with a valid and verified email address for your company can join your Viva Engage network. Viva Engage was created as an Enterprise Social Network with security built‚Äêin at every level and a high degree of control available. It includes integration with corporate security systems such as Microsoft Entra ID and single sign-on.

### Q: What is the difference between security of Viva Engage Basic and Viva Engage Enterprise?

A: The underlying security of both is identical. Viva Engage Enterprise brings more administrative control. It also provides the ability to integrate with other systems (such as Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Entra Federation Services, SharePoint, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and Salesforce).

For details of the security-related administrative controls available in Viva Engage Enterprise, see the tables at the beginning of this article.

### Q: Does Viva Engage sell our data?

A: No. Viva Engage doesn't mine or sell any customer data. All data belongs to the customer (either the user or the organization, dependent on the Viva Engage version in use).

### Q: Can I export all my data?

A: In Viva Engage Enterprise, verified admins can export messages and uploaded files that are stored in Viva Engage, along with their metadata. The data export can also include any content that has been deleted, if the **Archive** data retention option has been configured.

Viva Engage files that are stored in SharePoint must be exported by using Microsoft 365 content search and export. Use [Content Search in Microsoft 365](/office365/securitycompliance/content-search) to find the files, and then [Export the Content Search Results](/office365/securitycompliance/export-search-results).

### Q: What are Viva Engage's business continuity features?

A: Your data is backed up multiple times a day and protected with strong encryption on disk. Backups are transferred off-site over SSH and properly deleted after six months.

### Q: Is Viva Engage covered under the materials in the Microsoft 365 Trust Center?

A: Yes it is. See [Microsoft 365 Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=715692).

### Q: Is Viva Engage security independently verified?
