# Monitor private content in Viva Engage

Private content in Viva Engage should be just thatâ€”-private. However, sometimes there is a need for a verified admin to look into private messages or other content. For example, say you get a report that someone is harassing someone else on a private thread. You need to be able to make sure that members of the network are behaving according to your company's standards.
  
As the verified admin of a Viva Engage network, you can temporarily grant yourself access to private content to investigate issues. When you're done, you can turn off access by going back to the default mode where you can't read private content. Granting access to private content applies to the following types of content in Viva Engage:
  
- Private messages
    
- Private groups
    
- Messages, files, and notes in Private groups
    
- Profiles
  
 **Grant a verified admin access to private content on Viva Engage**
  
1. Sign in to Viva Engage as a verified admin.
    
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Edit network admin settings**.
    
3. Under **Content and Security**, select **Content Mode**.
    
4. Select **Private Content Mode**, and choose **Save**.
    
    When this mode is selected, you can see private conversations or content in private groups. A banner will show you that you are viewing private content. Private content is visible only to you, the verified admin who turned on Private Content Mode, not to all verified admins in the network.
    
When you are done investigating an issue, go back and set the network back to the default mode, where private content is not visible to verified admins.
  
 **Make private content private again, even to a verified admin**
  
1. Sign in to Viva Engage as a verified admin.
    
2. Go to **Settings** \> **Edit network admin settings**.
    
3. Under **Content and Security**, select **Content Mode**.
    
4. Select **Default Mode (Recommended)**, and choose **Save**.
