# Purpose: Viva Goals

Microsoft Viva Goals is a goal-alignment solution that connects teams to your organization’s strategic priorities. It uses the power of the objectives and key results (OKR) framework. Because Viva Goals is a part of Microsoft Viva, it integrates into the employee experience so users don't have to disrupt their everyday flow of work to check OKRs and update status.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

Viva Goals uses the ORK framework. OKRs align your entire organization to strategy, shifting focus from output—the everyday work of your team—to outcomes, which are the results of that work. This mindset shift keeps your team highly engaged with a clear sense of purpose and understanding of how everyone is contributing to forward momentum.

**Objectives** are what you and your team want to accomplish according to your definition of success.

**Key results** describe how you'll measure your success in accomplishing these goals.

For best results, teams and individuals should be aligned in a hierarchy.

**Initiatives/Projects** are focused efforts that help you achieve your key results.

Incorporating initiatives/projects in your OKR program ensures alignment between company-wide OKRs and the work prioritized by every department in your organization.

**Check-ins** are updates you make to share progress on your OKRs. When you update progress on a key result, it automatically updates the status of the parent objectives as appropriate.

The keys to success with OKRs are transparency and alignment. Right from the CEO to managers and colleagues, an employee can view anyone's OKRs in the system. This transparency fosters openness and removes conflicts and redundancies with work. OKRs are also aligned vertically and horizontally, allowing employees to see how their work connects with the organization's overall strategic goals.
