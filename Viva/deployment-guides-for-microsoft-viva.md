# Advanced deployment guides for Microsoft Viva

Deployment guides for Microsoft Viva give you tailored guidance and resources for planning and deploying security controls for your tenant, apps, and services.

All deployment guides are available in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224787) and in the [Microsoft 365 Setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2241022).


## Deployment guides

Deployment guides in the admin center require authentication to a Microsoft 365 tenant as an administrator or other role with access to the admin center, but guides in the Microsoft 365 Setup portal can be accessed by anyone. We have provided links to both locations for each guide, where available, in the following table.
