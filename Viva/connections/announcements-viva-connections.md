# Use announcements in Viva Connections

Announcements allow you to create and share time-sensitive messages in Viva Connections. You can set up, manage, and schedule announcements from your organization’s SharePoint home site.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Starting in October 2023, users will be required to have a Microsoft Viva suite or Viva Communications and Communities license to utilize the announcements feature. See [Microsoft Viva plans and pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/pricing) for more info.
> - You must have edit permissions or higher to your organization’s SharePoint home site or Viva Connections to author and manage announcements.
> - Announcements are unavailable in GCC, GCC High, and DoD environments. For more information, refer to the [list of service availability](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/office-365-us-government#service-availability-for-each-plan).

## When to use announcements

Announcements are the best way to communicate targeted, time-sensitive information in the Viva Connections app.

**Example Scenarios:**

- Remind employees in a specific role of an upcoming deadline.
- Share details about open enrollment benefits for full-time employees.
- Send a specific call to action for new employees.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For emergencies such as a safety hazard, it’s recommended to use multiple modes of communication.

### Best practices for using and writing announcements

- Use announcements sparingly so that users understand their importance. Sending them too frequently can cause users to disregard the notifications.
- Be aware that delivery time increases with the size of the targeted audience. Sending an announcement to a group of 50 users may take just a few minutes but sending one to 100,000 users may take several hours.
- Announcements aren’t designed for life-threatening emergencies.
- Keep messages short with a clear call to action. Plan to link to more information for complex topics.
- Specify which audiences need to receive the announcement to ensure the highest engagement possible.
- Allow users to dismiss announcements for less-urgent topics or when there are several high-impact announcements active at the same time.

## How announcements display in Viva Connections

Announcements will be viewable to users using desktop, tablet, and mobile experiences through Viva Connections

- **In Teams**: Users get a Teams notification alerting them of a new announcement within Teams and on their mobile device’s lock screen when the user has enabled it.

- **In Viva Connections**: Announcements will display towards the top of the Viva Connections experience where more details can be viewed.
