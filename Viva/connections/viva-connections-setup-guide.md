# Set up and launch Viva Connections 

Microsoft [Viva Connections](viva-connections-overview.md) is an employee experience app in Microsoft Teams that brings together relevant news, conversations, and resources in one place for your organization. It's built on your current Microsoft 365 ecosystem to help you engage, inform, and empower your hybrid workforce. The Viva Connections experience is deployed and accessed in Microsoft Teams.

Use these step-by-step instructions to help you set up and launch Viva Connections on desktop and mobile devices to create an engaging user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Content in this article reflects the [latest release of the Viva Connections desktop experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/new-experiences-for-viva-connections-are-now-rolling-out/ba-p/3729071) that will become available to all customers by the end of March 2023. Some users in your organization may see the new experience before others. 

**In this guide, you’ll learn how to**

- Set up Viva Connections 
- Set up Viva Connections and a SharePoint home site
- Add a home site after setting up Viva Connections 

Follow the instructions that are relevant for your organization. If you are unsure if your organization has a [SharePoint home site](home-site-plan.md), ask your SharePoint admin. Home sites can be added after you’ve set up Viva Connections, but it’s recommended that you do it before to reduce the risk of needing to manually copy content in some cases. Learn more about how [Viva Connections and home sites work together to create employee experiences](viva-connections-overview.md#how-sharepoint-home-sites-and-viva-connections-work-together).

[Get more detailed guidance](viva-connections-setup-overview.md) that focus on tasks in the plan, build, and launch phases. Or, review the [Viva Connections learning path](/training/paths/viva-connections-get-started/) get more in-depth guidance that includes fictitious business stories, examples, and knowledge checks.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - To complete these step-by-step instructions, ensure that you have permission to the SharePoint admin center (for customers who have a home site) and the Microsoft Teams admin center. Get more information about [permissions in SharePoint](/sharepoint/customize-sharepoint-site-permissions) and [permissions in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
> - Viva Connections is not supported on the Linux operating system.
> - Viva Connections is not currently supported on tablet devices. Continue to check the [Microsoft 365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=) for the status of tablet support.


## Set up Viva Connections without a home site
Follow these instructions when your organization only wants to set up Viva Connections. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/connections/step-vc.png" alt-text="Step diagram of how to add the Viva Connections app." lightbox="../media/connections/step-vc.png":::

### Step 1: Enable the Viva Connections app in the Microsoft Teams admin center  
Viva Connections does not have any requirements to get started. Start by adding the Viva Connections app, and then customize app settings to add your organization's logo, pre-install, and pre-pin the app for end users.

**Get started**
1.	[Add the Viva Connections app](add-viva-connections-app.md) in the Teams admin center (TAC).
2.	Then customize app settings like the app name and logo and decide user policies. Consider pre-pinning and pre-installing the app to improve app discoverability and adoption. 
3.	Finally, make the app available to end users by enabling the app.

**Permissions**
Teams administrator (or higher) permissions are required to add the Viva Connections app to the Teams Admin Center (TAC).

### Step 2: Choose app settings  
The Viva Connections app creates a custom app in Microsoft Teams. Your organization’s custom app will appear as a branded company app in the Microsoft Teams app center. Once the app is added, your organization’s icon will appear in the Teams app bar in the desktop and mobile Microsoft Teams experience. Users won’t see the app by default if you don’t pre-install and pre-pin.

**Get started**
1.	If you have pre-pinned the app for your users with Teams app set-up policies in step 4, then the app will automatically appear in users’ Teams mobile client apps on iOS and Android.
2.	If you have not pinned the app via policy, then users will first need to search for and install Viva Connections from the Teams desktop application. [Learn more about Viva Connections settings](https://support.microsoft.com/office/choose-settings-for-the-viva-connections-mobile-app-61bc93fe-5d58-4b4c-a0b1-abdd484ccf46).

**Permissions**
Teams administrator (or higher) permissions are required.

### Step 3: Assign owners and members 
Decide who should get access to editing elements of the landing experience. Assign at least 2 owners and a few members. If you are setting Viva Connections up for the first time, only owners of the SharePoint root site will be able to edit. When the home experience is edited for the first time, a SharePoint site on the backend will get created. You’ll want to assign (at least two) owners and members from this site to give permissions to others so they can edit the experience for the rest of the organization. [Learn more about what each role can do](edit-viva-home.md#manage-permissions).

**Get started**
1. Navigate to the Viva Connections app in Teams. 
2. Select the ellipsis (...) in the top-right and select **Manage permissions** and assign at least 2 owners and a few members. 
3. Alternatively, assign owners and members from the backend SharePoint site:

    - Select Edit in the dashboard section. 
    - Then select **Dashboard details**. 
    - Copy the link to the dashboard under **Properties > Name**. 
    - Paste the link in a browser and then go to **Settings > Permissions**. 



### Step 4: Finish customizing the experience 
After getting the app in Teams, choose the primary audience for this experience between employees who are generally frontline workers or information workers to select a set of default dashboard cards that can be edited or removed later. Add a custom banner image, add more cards to the dashboard (if desired), and set up navigational links to popular destinations in the navigation section. 

**Get started**
1. Learn more about [what content can be customized](edit-viva-home.md).
2. Upload a banner image, add more dashboard cards (if desired), and customize the navigation section. 

**Permissions**
Member or owner permissions are required to change banner image, edit the dashboard, and edit navigational content.

### Step 5: Let your users know how to access and use Viva Connections

## Set up a SharePoint home site and Viva Connections

### Step 1: Set a home site in SharePoint
A home site is a SharePoint communication site that acts as the front door to your organization’s intranet and has special capabilities such as the ability to prioritize news posted from the home site across the rest of the intranet. When you deploy Viva Connections, the SharePoint home site is automatically detected and a prominent link to the home site will display in the top-right corner of the Viva Connections experience. Alternatively, you can [choose to use the home site as the default landing experience](edit-viva-home.md#choose-the-default-landing-experience-for-viva-connections-desktop) if desired. 

> [!IMPORTANT]

The dashboard brings it all together – it provides a personalized landing experience and is designed to be the central destination where everyone can discover your organization's resources and complete daily tasks. [Apply audience targeting to dashboard cards](use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections.md) to give your users an experience tailored to their role and interests. Once you set up the dashboard, you will be able to use the [Dashboard web part on the home site](use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site.md).

The dashboard can be set up and edited from the home site, or you can edit dashboard content in Teams from the Viva Connections desktop app.

**Get started**

Users won’t see the app by default if you don’t pre-install and pre-pin.

**Get started**
1. If you have pre-pinned the app for your users with Teams app set-up policies in step 4, then the app will automatically appear in users’ Teams mobile client apps on iOS and Android.
