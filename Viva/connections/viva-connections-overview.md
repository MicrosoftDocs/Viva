## Components to Viva Connections 
Viva Connections is comprised of three primary components - the dashboard, the feed, and resources. Components display slightly differently between desktop and mobile devices.

| Component                  | Description                 |
| :------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Dashboard**                | [The dashboard](create-dashboard.md) is your employee’s digital toolset that brings together the resources your employees need whether they are in the office or in the field. The dashboard uses dynamic cards that employees can interact with to do things like clocking in for a shift, accessing training materials, reviewing paystub information, or booking a shuttle. It can also be used as a [web part on SharePoint home sites](use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site.md). <br><br> Cards in the Viva Connections dashboard are based on [adaptive cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) and the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview). They provide a low-code solution to bring your line-of-business apps into the dashboard. In addition, Viva Connections desktop combined with SharePoint home sites can also be further customized and extended using [SPFx web parts and extensions](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/overview-viva-connections).  | 
| **Feed**               | The Viva Connections feed delivers updates to the right people at the right time with powerful targeting and scheduling capabilities. It's tightly integrated with Viva Engage, SharePoint news, and Stream to display a personalized feed, based on post-level targeting of the groups that employees belong to. It supports both centralized corporate communication scenarios and democratized news scenarios. It's available in the Viva Connections Teams app and can also be used on SharePoint sites using the [Viva Connections feed web part](use-feed-web-part-for-viva-connections.md). | 
| **Resources**             | The Viva Connections resources experience enables way finding across popular destinations. It uses navigation elements from the [SharePoint global navigation](sharepoint-app-bar.md) and links can be [audience targeted.](use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections.md) | 



### Viva Connections dashboard

The Viva Connections dashboard enables you to create a curated experience using dashboard cards that give your employees access to their most critical content and tools. These cards are designed to enable quick task completion either by interacting with a card directly or by opening a quick view in the dashboard. Think of the Viva Connections dashboard as a digital toolset for your employees.

![Image of the viva connections Dashboard on mobile and desktop.](../media/connections/vc-dashboard-flw.png)

The Viva Connections dashboard is available on desktop, mobile platforms (iOS, Android), and [as a web part on SharePoint sites](use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site.md). This web part can be integrated into a SharePoint home site, which then is exposed as part of the Viva Connections for desktop experience in Teams.


#### Anatomy of a dashboard
A dashboard is made of medium-sized and large-sized cards which users can interact with to get information or complete a task.

**Users can select cards or click the buttons on cards to do things like:**
- Displaying a quick view with more information or an input form
- Navigating to a SharePoint page
- Accessing a Teams app
- Integrate with third party apps and services, including other Viva apps

Some cards can also reflect dynamic content that refreshes based on a user action or other event. For example, users can see new tasks assigned or required training courses when they open the dashboard. As the users mark the tasks as complete, the card updates to reflect their new number of tasks.

**In this example, view the experience for a dashboard card that enables a daily health check for on-site workers:**

![Animated GIF displaying how to interact with the dashboard.](../media/connections/new-vc-dashboard-interaction.gif)

The dashboard experience has been designed to be consistent across mobile platform and desktop, but there are some differences:


|Element  |Mobile  |Desktop  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Dashboard  |     Displays as the default tab in the Viva Connections app in Teams.    | It is prominently displayed in the desktop app and can be added to your SharePoint sites [as a web part](use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site.md).   |
|Dashboard layout   | Fixed in portrait mode. Card sizes can be medium (which shows two cards on one row) or large (which shows one card on a row).        |     Can be portrait or landscape with varying numbers of cards on each row depending on whether the web part is used in a 1-, 2-, or 3-column page section layout.     |
|Card UI     |  Native       |    HTML based     |
|Card order     |     Same as in Desktop    |  Same as in Mobile       |
|Card reflow    |   Same as in Desktop      |   Same as in Mobile      |
|How many cards are shown     |  All cards without audience targeting plus audience-targeted cards where the viewer is part of the targeted audience.       |   The number of cards to show can be specified in the Dashboard web part settings, but which cards are shown may vary depending on audience targeting.      |

#### Dashboard authoring
The dashboard can be authored directly in the Viva Connections app in Teams desktop. If you are using a home site, the dashboard can also be authored from the SharePoint home site.

:::image type="content" source="../media/connections/new-dashboard-creation.png" alt-text="Image showing how to edit a Viva Connections Dashboard." lightbox="../media/connections/new-dashboard-creation.png":::

The layout of the dashboard, including the size of the cards (which can be individually set as medium or large) can be customized. The layout of the cards may look different depending on whether the dashboard is being viewed on mobile, desktop, or in the dashboard web part.

#### Dashboard cards
The Viva Connections dashboard comes with a set of built-in cards, but is also designed to enable SaaS providers, system integrators, and in-house development teams create their own cards to meet their business needs.

:::image type="content" source="../media/connections/dashboard-cards.png" alt-text="Image showing Dashboard cards." lightbox="../media/connections/dashboard-cards.png":::

Cards in the Viva Connections Dashboard are based on adaptive cards and the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/get-started/build-first-sharepoint-adaptive-card-extension). They provide a low-code solution to bring your line-of-business apps into the Dashboard.

### Viva Connections feed

In the Viva Connections app, users will see a personalized feed with relevant information from across their organization. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/connections/vc-feed-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the feed in desktop." lightbox="../media/connections/vc-feed-new.png":::

The feed automatically balances fresh and engaging content with corporate communications to keep users interested, while also ensuring that they see the most important messages. Individual messages can be promoted to raise greater awareness among users by using [SharePoint’s news boost feature](https://support.microsoft.com/office/boost-sharepoint-news-from-organization-news-sites-46ad8dc5-8f3b-4d81-853d-8bbbdd0f9c83) and Viva Engage's (formerly called Yammer) "Featured" options. The feed requires usage of modern SharePoint or Yammer communities, but the best experience is delivered when both are used together.

#### Feed content sources
Individual content items in the Feed will display for a 30-day period. Users will see content aggregated from the following sources, provided they have permissions to access the content from that source:
- **SharePoint news**
    - News posts from the home site
    - News posts from organization news sites
    - News posts from communication and teams sites
- **Viva Engage Community Posts** 
    - Posts to the organization's community
    - Featured posts
    - Posts to communities that the user follows
- **Stream (built on SharePoint)**
    - [Video news links](video-news-links.md) on organization news sites
    - Video in a SharePoint news post

#### Feed resources

[Frequently asked questions about the feed](faqs-viva-connections-feed.md)

Prioritize SharePoint news posts in the Feed by [using SharePoint news boost](https://support.microsoft.com/office/boost-news-from-organization-news-sites-46ad8dc5-8f3b-4d81-853d-8bbbdd0f9c83)

Use the [Feed web part for Viva Connections on SharePoint sites](use-feed-web-part-for-viva-connections.md)


### Viva Connections resources

Resources are the navigational links that are set up and customized from the Teams app, or in the [SharePoint global navigation](sharepoint-app-bar.md) for organizations with a [SharePoint home site]home-site-plan.md). These resources will be displayed on both the desktop and mobile instances of Viva Connections. Resources include customized navigational links and dynamically generated links to frequent and followed SharePoint sites.

![Screenshot of the resources section on desktop.](../media/connections/vc-resources-new.png)

In the mobile app, users can view resources by selecting the **Resources** tab. This type of functioning provides users with a familiar navigation structure and allows them to open sites, pages, news, and more—right from their mobile devices.



## Viva Connections mobile and desktop experiences
Both desktop and mobile experiences are centered around the three main components – the dashboard, feed, and resources. The desktop app features all three components at-a-glance, and the mobile view uses tabs to make it easier to scroll through content.

![Screenshot of the Viva Connections desktop experience.](../media/connections/vc-full.png)

**Key capabilities of the desktop experience:**
- **Home for the Viva suite:** The new desktop experience of the connections app plays the role of the home for the suite. It offers easy discovery and navigation to all the Viva modules that the employee is licensed for, bringing together the connection, insight, growth, and purpose pillars of Microsoft Viva.
- Navigation between other Viva experiences: Navigational elements located in the top-right and top-left corners, navigational elements help viewers easily get to-and-from other landing pages and [other Viva experiences](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/introducing-microsoft-viva-3c1012cb-6c85-4d49-bd7f-b18a6e7873e0). 
- **Global navigation and way finding:** The desktop experience provides employees the ability to navigate to important resources using the global navigation curated by your organization, the important sites your organization frequently engages with, and with organizational news. This navigation panel appears when users select the branded app icon in Teams, and surfaces elements shared with the [SharePoint global navigation](sharepoint-app-bar.md).
- **Access specific tools based on roles:** Throughout the Viva Connections experience, [content can be targeted to specific audiences](use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections.md) to ensure they have the right tools at the right time.
- **Stay updated on news personalized to the viewer:** Users can stay up to date with news, conversations, and videos in a curated news stream based on the sites and communities that they follow.
- **Easily share content:** Content consumed within Teams can be easily shared into chats or channels, making collaboration easier.



#### The Viva Connections mobile experience
The experience in the Viva Connections mobile app is anchored around three key concepts: the dashboard, the feed, and resources.
<br>

## Curated and tailored experiences
Viva Connections gives you and your content creators the tools for both curated and tailored experiences. A curated experience is one in which the user sees content chosen by a site owner or author. For example, a site owner controls the content used on the site and whether the content is audience targeted. [Audience targeting](use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections.md) is accomplished using Azure Active Directory (AAD) groups for card-level targeting in the dashboard and menu-item targeting in the global navigation. 

A tailored experience is one in which content is automatically displayed according to what is most relevant to the users. This content might include content from the sites they follow, their Yammer group memberships, popular content, and more. An example of tailored content is the feed.


- **Home site (optional, curated)**: A home site is not required for Viva Connections, but can be used as a secondary landing destination for organizational content and news. A site owner controls the layout of the home site, the elements used on that site, and targeting of content to specific audiences.
- **Dashboard (curated)**: A dashboard author controls the curation of the dashboard and can target each card on the dashboard to specific audiences using existing AAD groups. These provisions allow dashboard authors to create different experiences for each group. And because Viva Connection uses AAD groups, authors benefit from dynamic group memberships to reduce administrative overhead. Authors can easily preview what the dashboard will look like across devices and audiences.
- **Feed (tailored)**: The Viva Connections feed uses its own heuristics to tailor the feed for an employee by bringing in the most relevant content for that employee. It utilizes signals in the content created across the organization. Some of the signals used are Yammer group memberships, sites where news is posted, content popularity, and the intended audiences for a post. The feed also supports promotional capabilities such as using [SharePoint news boost](https://support.microsoft.com/office/boost-news-from-organization-news-sites-46ad8dc5-8f3b-4d81-853d-8bbbdd0f9c83).
- **Resources (curated)**: The list of sites on the resources experience in mobile includes the global navigation defined at the organization level. The global navigation supports AAD groups for targeting so that employees in different groups will see relevant navigation items.



|Capability name |Curated vs. tailored  |Details  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Home site**     | Curated, optional        |   Organization’s with SharePoint home sites (optional) can control the layout, web parts, and audience targeting of content.     |
|**Dashboard**     | Curated         |   Author selects cards to show and uses AAD groups to [target content to specific audiences](use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections.md).   |
|**Feed**    |     Tailored    |   Content is automatically prioritized and displayed based on signals associated with content from SharePoint and [Viva Engage](/viva/engage/overview).      |
|**Resources**     |  Curated       |  Using AAD groups, menu items in the global navigation can be targeted to specific audiences.        |


## Branding
Matching your organizational brand is integral to your employees’ connection with your company's values and goals. The branding you apply in Teams to the Viva Connections app – including your logo and colors – is automatically applied to the mobile app. For information on how to apply your branding in an app, review [how to customize apps in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/customize-apps). The desktop app offers an opportunity for further branding by [customizing the banner image](edit-viva-home.md#customize-the-banner-image).


## Localization
Viva Connections is available in most major languages used in Microsoft 365. Learn more about [how to set up the Viva Connections mobile experience in a specific language](viva-connections-language.md) and [how to create a dashboard in more than one language](create-multilingual-dashboard.md).

   - **Dashboard:** Content can be set by dashboard authors to support multiple languages.
   - **Feed:** The content will be available in the format in which it was authored, and SharePoint news posts will display author-translated posts in the user’s preferred language.
   - **Resources:** Are linked to the global navigation experience and follows the tenant’s default language.


## Extensibility
Many components to the Viva Connections experience can be customized. The [SharePoint Framework](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview) (SPFx) is the recommended SharePoint customization and extensibility model for developers because of the tight integration between SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Viva Connections. The SPFx is the only extensibility and customization option for Viva Connections. [Learn more about Viva Connections extensibility](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/overview-viva-connections).


## How SharePoint home sites and Viva Connections work together
Viva Connections and home sites are two complementary methods to creating powerful employee experiences that can be viewed on the web and in Teams. A [SharePoint home site](home-site-plan.md) is an employee experience that serves as a landing destination, news hub, and the main entry-point to your organization’s intranet. Both Viva Connections and home site experiences are designed to unite and empower your organization and automatically integrate with each other to form a cohesive and branded experience. 

Use Viva Connections as the primary destination where employees access job-specific tools and news and home sites as a secondary source of organizational news, events, and resources. Viva Connections is where individuals get access to curated content based on their role, and the home site is where they can find more organizational-focused resources. 


### Shared functionality 

![Graphic of a Venn diagram that displays the similarities and differences between Viva Connections and home sites.](../media/connections/vc-vs-home-site-venn.png)

Both share many common capabilities like news roll ups, navigation, and third-party extensibility to ensure these solutions work together. Both types of experiences share basic functionality, like the ability to use audience targeting, distribute organizational news, and [share the same permissions model](edit-viva-home.md) to make it easy for editors to access and manage. 


### Viva Connections automatically detects home sites
For organizations that already have a home site, or know they want one in the future, the home site is automatically detected by Viva Connections, and a prominent link will display at the top-right of the desktop experience. Users can easily navigate between both – so you don’t have to choose one over the other.

![Graphic of the banner image in the header with the home site link highlighted.](../media/connections/home-site-link-focus.png)home-site-link-focus

### You can choose the default landing experience 
Unless specified, Viva Connections is the default experience for the desktop app in Teams. When Viva Connections is the default, a link to the home site will display in the top-right corner to ensure easy navigation between the two experiences. We recognize that some organizations with a home site want the home site to be the default experience. When the home site is the default experience, a link to Viva Connections will display in the top-right corner. [Learn more about choosing the default experience](edit-viva-home.md#choose-the-default-landing-experience-for-viva-connections-desktop).
