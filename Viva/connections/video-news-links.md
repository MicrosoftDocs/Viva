## How to publish a Video news link

You can publish videos hosted on SharePoint sites as news posts in the Viva Connections Feed from the **+ New** menu on any SharePoint organizational news site.  

1.  Select the video in OneDrive or SharePoint that you want to publish.

2.  Create a sharing link with the appropriate permissions for the intended viewing audience.  

    > [!TIP]
    > Create a sharing link that includes members of your organization that already have access to the video so they can play it.

> Scheduling and audience targeting is available from the **Page details** option at the top of the page when the page is in edit mode.
