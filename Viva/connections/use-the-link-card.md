## Considerations for the navigation experience
When the user clicks on the link from the link card to navigate to the content, depending on the target URL and the device (Viva Connections on Teams mobile vs. Viva Connections on Teams desktop), the behavior might be different as described in the table below.

The best experiences will be achieved if the service does not require authentication and is anonymously accessible. For content that is stored in M365, authentication is automatically handled. For third-party services requiring authentication, the recommendation is to [use a Dashboard card built by the third-party](/viva/connections/create-dashboard#add-a-third-party-card-or-microsoft-app) which will handle authentication.
