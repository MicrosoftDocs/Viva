# Use the Web link card to integrate existing content into the Viva Connections dashboard

The [Web link card](/viva/connections/create-dashboard#add-a-web-link-card) is a simple yet powerful option to incorporate existing content from across your Microsoft 365 environment and elsewhere into Viva Connections to offer a seamless employee experience.

## Considerations for the navigation experience

When the user selects the link from the link card to navigate to the content, depending on the target URL and the device (Viva Connections on Teams mobile vs. Viva Connections on Teams desktop), the behavior might be different as described in the following table.

The best experiences will be achieved if the service doesn't require authentication and is anonymously accessible. For content that is stored in M365, authentication is automatically handled. For third-party services requiring authentication, the recommendation is to [use a dashboard card built by a third-party](/viva/connections/create-dashboard#add-a-third-party-card-or-microsoft-app) to will handle authentication.
