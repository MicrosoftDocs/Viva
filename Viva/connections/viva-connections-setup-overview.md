## Overview of setting up Viva Connections

Viva Connections doesn’t require a SharePoint home site to get started and offers minimal setup and includes default cards on the dashboard to help get you started. Tasks marked with an asterisk (*) are optional, or may only apply to customers who will use home sites to complement the Viva Connections experience.

## Overview of activities in each phase

| Phase                 | Steps and tasks                 |  
| :-------------------: | :------------------- |
| **Plan**  | **Step 1: Plan for Viva Connections** <br> Identify and align on key tasks and scenarios that can be supported by Viva Connections. [Learn more about how Viva Connections and home sites work together.](viva-connections-overview.md#how-sharepoint-home-sites-and-viva-connections-work-together)  <br><br> **Step 2: Set a home site (optional)*** <br> Determine if a standalone Viva Connections in Teams or one with an intranet portal is needed. If it's the one with the intranet portal, prepare your communications site. <br><br> **Step 3: Plan the dashboard** <br> Learn more about the different kinds of cards and how they can support specific scenarios. <br><br> **Step 4: Get ready for the Feed** <br> Consider ways to influence the order of content in the Feed. <br><br> **Step 5: Plan Resources** <br> Determine which links belong in the resources section. <br><br> **Step 6: Create an adoption plan** <br> Create a plan to help the rest of the organization adopt Viva Connections.

Connections is meeting specific needs. <br><br> **Step 8: Plan for maintenance over time** <br> Consider which parts of the experience may need to be refreshed over time.|  
| **Build** | **Step 1: Start creating a Viva Connections experience in the Microsoft admin center** <br> Choose to create a single experience for the whole organization, or multiple experiences that service distinct audiences. You can create standalone experiences, or choose to build off an existing intranet portal to set it as a SharePoint home site. <br><br> **Step 2: Pin the Viva Connections app in Microsoft Teams** <br> After the creation of your first experience, pin the app in the Teams admin center to make Viva Connections easily discoverable to users. <br><br> **Step 3: Ensure high-traffic sites and portals are healthy** <br> Run a health check and make sure everyone has access to the right content. <br><br> **Step 4: Test and refine the experience** <br> Find people in your organization who can test the experience before it's released more broadly. |  
| **Launch** | **Step 1: Consider tactics to spread the news** <br> Think about where different audiences usually get news. <br><br> **Step 2: Announce Viva Connections** <br> Use more than one communication channel to reach audiences.  <br><br> **Step 3: Use champions and provide continued support** <br> Continue to use early adopters to help others get the most out of Viva Connections.|
