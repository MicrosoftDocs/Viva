# Create a Viva Connections dashboard and add cards

The Viva Connections dashboard provides fast and easy access to information and job-related tasks. Content on the dashboard can be targeted to users in specific roles, markets, and job functions.
The dashboard consists of cards that engage viewers with existing Microsoft Teams apps, Viva apps and services, third-party apps, custom solutions using the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) framework, internal links, and external links.

![Diagram of how to create a Viva Connections Dashboard.](../media/connections/viva-dashboard-step.png)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When setting up Viva Connections for the first time, you’ll be asked to choose a set of default cards based on the intended audience.
> - You can choose mobile and desktop views interchangeably as you’re authoring.
> - Image recommendations for cards in the dashboard: medium cards should be 300x150 to 400x200 with 2:1 aspect ratio and large cards 300x300 to 400x400 with 1:1 aspect ratio to prevent stretching in the mobile app.
> - Image URLS in card properties must be an absolute URL for the link to work in the mobile app.
> - It's recommended to limit the number of cards to about 20 on the dashboard for the best viewing experience.
> - Users will be able to [customize their dashboard on Viva Connections mobile](https://support.microsoft.com/office/753e0607-0bfd-4712-ad7e-18490dd565a2#bkmk_customize-viva-connections-mobile-dashboard) by reordering, hiding, and showing cards. These changes only affect the mobile experience for the user and will not affect their desktop or tablet experience.

1. Navigate to the Viva Connections app in Teams.

2. Next, select **Edit** in the dashboard section.

3. Select **+ Add a card**.

4. Select **Edit** (pencil icon) for each card to edit properties like the label, icon, image, and audience targeting settings where applicable.

5. Select **Delete** (trash can icon) to remove cards.

6. Preview the experience on all devices to ensure usability before publishing or republishing.

7. **Publish** or **Republish** when you're done to share the edits with others.

## How to edit the dashboard from SharePoint when you have a home site

If your organization has a [SharePoint home site](home-site-plan.md), you can set up and edit the dashboard from the SharePoint home site or in Microsoft Teams. You need [edit permissions](/sharepoint/customize-sharepoint-site-permissions) for the SharePoint home site to make changes.

<br>
<br>

> [!NOTE]
>Images are an important aspect to making your cards rich and inviting. If you're a SharePoint admin, we recommend enabling a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve performance for getting images. Consider when storing images that /siteassets is by default a CDN source when Private CDN is enabled while /style library is the default source when the Public CDN is enabled. [Learn more about CDNs](/office365/enterprise/content-delivery-networks).  

1. From the SharePoint home site, select the **Settings** gear at the top-right of the page.

2. Select **Manage Viva Connections**.

3. Select the **+ Create dashboard** or **View dashboard** button.

4. Select **+ Add a card**.

5. Select the type of card you want to add from the dashboard card toolbox and then use the instructions within this article to set up each type of card. As you’re building the dashboard, you can preview its appearance in mobile and desktop for different audiences.

6. When you're done adding cards and [applying targeting to specific audiences](use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections.md), **Preview** the experience to ensure an ideal viewing experience.

7. Once you’re satisfied with how the dashboard looks in preview, select **Publish** or **Republish** at the top-right of your dashboard to make it available for use on your home site, in Teams, and in the Teams mobile app.

## Design your own card with the card designer

Use the Card Designer to create cards that can link to other sites, open media, display a location, open a teams app, and more. Card designer gives users the ability to quickly build "custom" cards without the need for custom code by using a template with the option to create a secondary view, also called a quick view.

Quick view is a powerful tool that enables the card designer to create cards that go beyond the traditional dashboard cards to create something interactive and informative using [Adaptive Card](https://adaptivecards.io/) JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You'll be able to "code" a single quick view by using the power of Adaptive Card markup to make their cards dynamic. The result can be previewed within the card designer before sharing with others.

> [!NOTE]
>
> To design your own cards using quick view, you should be familiar with JSON and Adaptive Card templates. For more information, see [Adaptive Cards Templating](/adaptive-cards/templating/).

:::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-card-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example of a large card created with the card designer for celebrating birthdays with a button to congratulate displayed." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-card-example.png":::

### Use a card template

The card designer has a set of card view templates that can be used to easily create cards with helpful information, links, and media. The following steps walk you through creating a new large sized card using the image template to create a link for users.

1. While in **edit** mode, select **+ Add a card** from the dashboard.

2. Select **Card designer**.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="This screenshot shows the icon to select to add a Card designer card." source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-card-icon.png":::

3. After selecting the Card designer card, select the **Edit** icon to open the property pane.

4. As you create your card through selecting options, a preview of how the card looks will appear to the left of the options.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-properties-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an overview of the card designer properties pane." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-properties-overview.png":::

5. Under **Template type**, select one of three **templates** to apply:
   - **Heading**: Create a card with a simple heading.
   - **Image**: Create a card with a heading and image.
   - **Description**: Create a card with a heading and description.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Buttons are disabled when selecting the Image template for a medium sized card, but a card action can still be assigned to trigger when the user selects the card.

   Depending on the template type chosen, fields matching the template type will populate in the **card content** section. For example, if you chose the Image template, you’ll be able to enter values for the Image and Heading properties in their respective text boxes.

6. Select a **card size**:

   - **Medium**: the default card size and allows you to add one button to the Heading and Description templates.
   - **Large**: takes the space of two medium cards together and allows the use of two buttons.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-layout-and-size.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing options under the layout and size category in the properties pane.":::

7. Under **Card icon** select one of the following options:

   - **Custom image**: Select **custom image** then **Change** to upload your own image or select an existing image from your site or from an online source (for example, web search, OneDrive, Site).
   - **Library**: Select an icon from a pre-existing list of available icons.
   For example, select **Library** then **Change** to choose a new icon.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > When uploading custom images for your icons, we recommend using PNG images between 24x24 and 32x32 pixels.

8. Enter a **Title** to be displayed at the top of your card.

9. Enter a **Heading**.

10. Depending on the template type chosen, enter values for the properties corresponding to your selection below the heading field. For this example, the image template is being shown:

    - **Image**: Select **change** to upload your own image or select an existing image from your site or from an online source (for example, web search, OneDrive, Site).

      :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-adding-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing options under the card content category in the properties pane.":::

11. Under card action, select an action to be performed when a user selects the card. Depending on the action selected, more fields will appear to customize the action.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > The card action cannot be disabled.

    - **Show the quick view**: Select to use JSON code to create a more interactive dashboard card. If selected, the **Save** button changes to **Next**, which leads to more settings for customizing your quick view card. For steps on using quick view, refer to [add a quick view to a card](#add-a-quick-view-to-a-card).

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > One quick view is available for each card, which can be opened as the card action, or by using a button.

    - **Go to a link**: Enter a URL that users will be directed to.
    - **Go to teams app**: the user will be directed to the specified teams app by the URL provided (admins can also use the appID to direct users to the appropriate Teams app. See the article on how to [Deep link to an application](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/deep-link-application?tabs=teamsjs-v2#configure-deep-link-manually-using-your-app-id) for more information).

    For example, selecting **Go to a link** from the dropdown displays a field for entering the link.

12. Under **Link**, enter the **URL** you wish users to be directed to.

13. Buttons can be toggled on and off (where available). If enabled, the same values found under card action can be selected for the **Primary** and **Secondary** buttons.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > When using a medium sized card, only one button can be enabled using the heading or description template. The image template will disable the use of buttons when medium size is selected.

    For this example, the **Primary button** is set to direct users to the same link as the card action. The **Secondary button** is disabled.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-set-card-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing options under the actions category in the properties pane.":::

14. Under **Audiences to target** enter one or more groups to target so only those audiences specified see the card in the dashboard. See the article on [audience targeting in Viva Connections](/viva/connections/use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections) for more information.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-audience-targeting.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing options under the audience targeting category in the properties pane.":::

15. Select **Save** to save the updates to your card.

### Add a quick view to a card

Quick view allows you to add adaptive card JSON code to Dashboard cards to provide a more comprehensive, interactive, and engaging experience to users. By using static or dynamic data sources (like [SharePoint Representational State Transfer (REST) API](/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-to-know-the-sharepoint-rest-service?tabs=csom#construct-rest-urls-to-access-sharepoint-resources) or [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/call-api)), cards can be created that provide information within the Connections experience, without the user having to navigate away.

To get started, follow the steps in [Use a card template](#use-a-card-template) up to selecting a **Card action**.

1. Under **card action** select **Show the quick view**.

2. Finish setting up your card by enabling or disabling buttons and selecting actions for active buttons.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > One quick view is available for each card, which can be opened as the card action, or by using a button.

3. Select **Next** to display the quick view layout.

4. A preview of how the card looks on the dashboard displays to the left of the options.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-quickview-layout.png" alt-text="Screenshot selecting show the quick view from a dropdown of options under the actions category in the properties pane." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-quickview-layout.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > The [Adaptive Card designer](https://www.adaptivecards.io/designer/) tool can be used to help create the JSON Template and Data code for your card. For more information on the adaptive card structure and creating adaptive cards, see [Getting Started - Adaptive Cards](/adaptive-cards/authoring-cards/getting-started).

5. In the **Template JSON** field, enter your JSON code that contains the structure of your Adaptive Card.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-template-json.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the quick view options in the properties pane.":::

6. Under **Type of Content**, select one of the following options for your data set:

   - **Static**: displays static information and must be manually updated.
   - **Dynamic**: integrates with data sources from SharePoint API or Microsoft Graph to automatically update content.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > Selecting **Dynamic** content will display additional options allowing you to select the data source and API endpoint.

#### Selecting Static as the type of content

1. In the **Data JSON** field, enter your JSON code that contains the data to be displayed within your Adaptive Card.

2. In the **Audiences to target** field, enter any audiences you wish to target the card to.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-static-content-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing static content selected with the Data JSON field displayed in the properties pane and a preview of the finished card." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-static-content-preview.png":::

#### Selecting Dynamic as the type of content with SharePoint as the data source

1. From the **Data Source** dropdown, select **SharePoint API**.

2. In the **API endpoint**, enter the REST URL endpoint you wish to use.

   For example, if you wanted to retrieve the title of a SharePoint site, you would enter `title` in the **API Endpoint** field (since `web/` is already part of the default prefix). See this article for more [examples of SharePoint REST endpoints](/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-to-know-the-sharepoint-rest-service?tabs=csom#sharepoint-rest-endpoint-examples).

3. The **Data JSON response preview** will open and display the code used. A preview of how the card looks on the dashboard appears to the left of the property pane.

4. In the Audiences to target field, enter any audiences you wish to target the card to.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-dynamic-sharepoint-api.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing dynamic content selected with SharePoint API as the endpoint and the Data JSON field displayed in the properties pane." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-dynamic-sharepoint-api.png":::

5. Select **Save** to save your updates to your custom card.

#### Selecting Dynamic as the type of content with Microsoft Graph as the data source

1. From the **Data Source** dropdown, select **Microsoft Graph**.

2. Select the **Graph version** from the dropdown (where version is the target service version, usually 1.0).

3. In the **API endpoint**, enter the REST URL endpoint you wish to use.

   For example, if you wanted to retrieve the profile and photo of a specific user, you would enter the Microsoft Graph REST URL `me/photo/$value` in the **API Endpoint** field. See more [common use cases in 1.0 for Microsoft Graph REST API](/graph/api/overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&source=recommendations#common-use-cases&preserve-view=true) here.

4. The **Data JSON response preview** will open and display the code used and a preview of how the card looks on the dashboard appears to the left of the property pane.

5. In the **Audiences to target** field, enter any audiences you wish to target the card to.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-dynamic-graph-api.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing dynamic content selected with Microsoft Graph API as the endpoint and the Data JSON field displayed in the properties pane." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/card-designer-dynamic-graph-api.png":::

6. Select **Save** to save updates to your custom card.

## Add a third party card or Microsoft app

The Viva Connections dashboard and mobile experience can be extended and customized using cards, which are based on [adaptive cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) and the [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview). These adaptive cards are used to display data, complete tasks, and connect to Teams Apps, Websites, and mobile apps on Viva Connections. They provide a low-code solution to bring your line-of-business apps into the dashboard.

To create custom experiences on Viva Connections dashboard and Viva Connections Mobile App, developers must use the SPFx to create custom ACEs. To learn more about creating ACEs, see the following tutorial: [Build your first SharePoint Adaptive Card Extension](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/get-started/build-first-sharepoint-adaptive-card-extension). Learn more about [Viva Connections extensibility.](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/overview-viva-connections)

### Add a third party card

There are three ways to get third-party apps and solutions integrated with the Viva Connections dashboard. There are three ways to get third-party apps and solutions integrated with the Viva Connections dashboard. The following is an example of a third-party card.

![Example of a third-party card.](../media/connections/third-party-card-example.png)

#### Option 1: Discover and request apps from the Viva Connections card toolbox

Third-party cards and an entry point to browse more cards in the app store will automatically display in the card toolbox. Depending on your level of permissions, you may need to request the app before it can be used on the dashboard. [Learn more about managing third-party apps](/sharepoint/use-app-catalog).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Site owners managing the Viva Connections dashboard will need to request third-party apps before they are available in the card toolbox.
> - Some third-party apps require a service plan agreement with your organization.

:::image type="content" alt-text="This screenshot is of the card toolbox section that displays third party cards." source="../media/connections/third-party-card-toolbox.png":::

1. While in edit-mode, select **+ Add** card from the dashboard.
2. You’ll see third-party options in the **Suggested cards** section. Select one of the cards that’s displayed or browse more cards by selecting **Add more cards**.
3. Request the cards you’d like to add to the toolbox and the requests will be sent to the App Catalog Admin for their approval.
4. You'll receive an email to confirm if your request has been approved or denied.
5. Once your request has been approved, refresh the page, and you’ll see the new card display in the toolbox.

#### Option 2: Acquire the app from a Microsoft AppSource or the SharePoint store

- If you're building a dashboard, you can [request the app directly](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/explore-and-deploy-sharepoint-framework-solutions-from-partners/ba-p/2645289), but you'll need approval from an admin of the tenant-level app catalog to continue with the installation
- If you're an **admin** of a tenant-level app catalog, you can deploy business apps directly.
You can acquire apps from third- party developers by browsing the [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=sharepoint) or [SharePoint store](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/explore-and-deploy-sharepoint-framework-solutions-from-partners/ba-p/2645289) (recommended).

[Get step-by-step guidance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sharepoint-blog/explore-and-deploy-sharepoint-framework-solutions-from-partners/ba-p/2645289) on how to request and deploy an app, and add an app to your site. For tenant admin, [learn how to manage apps](/sharepoint/use-app-catalog#work-with-sharepoint-store-apps) in the App Catalog.

#### Option 2: Acquire the app directly from the third-party developer

## Add a Viva Pulse card

Invite managers and team leads to send requests for feedback or view feedback results using the [Viva Pulse](/viva/pulse/introduction-to-viva-pulse) card. The card provides a way for feedback authors to access and interact with active or recently closed feedback pulses providing you with a direct link to your account in the Viva Pulse Teams app.

> [!NOTE]
>
> It’s recommended admins set up the Viva Pulse app for their organization and pin it as an app in Microsoft Teams so users can fully experience the Viva Pulse card. Refer to the article on [manage, install, and pin Viva Pulse in the Teams admin center](/viva/pulse/setup-admin-access/manage-install-pin-viva-pulse-in-teams-admin-center) for more information.

Content in the card is dynamic and changes according to the [users role](/viva/pulse/introduction-to-viva-pulse#roles) in Viva Pulse and if a feedback pulse is active. The following are examples of Viva Pulse card states that display different information depending on the viewer’s role and if any active or recently closed feedback pulses are available.

The Pulse card will tell feedback authors the number of responses an active or recently closed pulse has received and provides a link to feedback results in their Viva Pulse account for the recently closed pulse. When multiple feedback results are available, authors will be directed to their **Pulses sent** tab within the Viva Pulse Teams app.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/pulse-card-author-closed-state.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing two states of the Viva Pulse card." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/pulse-card-author-closed-state.png":::

When no open pulses are available the card will display **send a pulse**, which will bring the author to the Viva Pulse Teams app where they can create a new request for feedback to be sent out.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/create-dashboard/pulse-card-author-send-pulse.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the send a pulse state of the Viva Pulse card." lightbox="../media/connections/create-dashboard/pulse-card-author-send-pulse.png":::

9. To target your card to specific audiences (that is, only audiences you specify will see the card in the dashboard), select one or more groups to target. For more information on audience targeting, see [Audience targeting](#apply-audience-targeting-to-cards).

## Apply audience targeting to cards

[Audience targeting can be applied throughout](use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections.md) the Viva Connections experience, including cards on the dashboard. Audience targeting creates a personalized viewing experience by filtering the most important content to specific groups. Use audience targeting to:

- Create custom views for distinct roles and regions.
- Generate as many different views as needed to create unique experiences.
- Ensure the intended audience sees the most important content.

### Set the target audiences for a card

1. If your page isn't already in **edit** mode, select **Edit** at the top-right of the dashboard page.
2. Select the card you want to target to one or more audiences, and select the **Edit card** pencil from the toolbar on the left.
3. In the property pane on the right, under **Audiences to target**, type or search for the audience group(s) you want to target.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you've selected an audience group that you recently created or changed, it may take some time to see targeting applied for that group.

4. When a card is successfully audience targeted, you’ll see a **people** icon in the lower-left corner of the card.

   ![Audience targeting confirmation icon.](../media/connections/audience-targeting-icon.png)

### Preview your dashboard to see how it displays for different audiences

After creating or editing cards on the dashboard, make sure you preview the experience for each audience and on both desktop and mobile devices. What you see in *preview mode* approximates how the dashboard displays for certain audiences and devices. When you apply audience targeting to cards, you can preview how different people view the dashboard depending on the audience or device. While in preview-mode, make sure:

- There aren’t any physical gaps between cards that may appear while previewing different audiences and devices. If you see gaps, rearrange cards so that every audience and device will have a high-quality viewing experience.
- Icons, graphics, and images are easy to identify and understand.
- Buttons and links are active and go to their intended destinations.
- Labels and description text are helpful, easy to read, and make sense for the intended audience.

#### To preview different audiences

1. While in edit mode, select **Preview** on the top right.

   ![Audience targeting icon.](../media/connections/preview-dashboard.png)

2. Open the **Select audiences to preview as** drop-down list. (if no cards are audience targeted, you'll see a disabled **Audience targeting** label).

   :::image type="content" alt-text="This screenshot shows the audience targeting group label." source="../media/connections/preview-audiences.png":::

3. Search for and select a group. Once added, the group will be selected by default. You can select the group again in the **Select audiences to preview as** drop-down list to deselect it.

   ![Audience targeting panel in preview mode.](../media/connections/preview-dash-full-page.png)

   - Cards that targeted to a specific group will display.
   - When one or more audiences are selected, cards that *don't* have audience targeting applied will also display.
   - If no audiences are targeted, only cards that *aren't* audience targeted will display. If there aren't any cards with audience targeting applied, none will display.
   - If you aren't part of one of the audiences you've selected, you'll only see cards that aren't audience targeted. If none of the cards are audience targeted, you won't see any cards.

#### Examples

In the following example, the preview is set for mobile devices and highlights the different views that can be created from a single dashboard.

| View 1                  | View 2                 |
| :-------------------: | :-------------------: |
|![Image of one view created for a specific audiences.](../media/connections/preview-dash-1.png) | ![Image of a second view created for a specific audiences..](../media/connections/preview-dash-2.png) |

## Use the Dashboard web part for Viva Connections

> [!NOTE]
>
> - After editing content on the dashboard, it may take several minutes until the new content is available in the Dashboard web part.
> - For best results, we recommend placing the Dashboard web part in a right vertical section.

Once a dashboard is authored and published, you can use the Dashboard web part to display it on your Connections site. You can add the web part to any section on your page.  

![Image of the Viva Connections Dashboard web part highlighted in the Connections site.](../media/connections/vc-dashboard-web-part.png)

When added, it will automatically be populated with the cards from the existing dashboard on your site. You can set the maximum number of cards you want to display. [Learn how to use the Dashboard web part](/sharepoint/use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site).

## How URLs and single Sign-on works

For some cards, you'll use links to URLs. Depending on the location of the content, links to URLs may display content in Microsoft Teams or elsewhere and [Single sign-on (SSO)](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on) behavior can differ. Get more information about how links to URLs and SSO behave depending on the location of the content you're linking to.

> [!NOTE]
> When SSO is not supported, users will be asked to enter their login credentials.
