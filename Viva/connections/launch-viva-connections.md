# Launch Viva Connections for your organization

After your organization has finished the [planning](plan-viva-connections.md), [building](build-viva-connections.md), and testing of Viva Connections, it’s time to let the rest of the organization know that it's available for use.

## Step 1: Consider tactics to spread the news

Consider where and how different audiences get news and announcements. For example, frontline workers might get the most important news in team meetings and hybrid workers might be used to getting SharePoint news in Outlook.

- **Announce your organization’s instance of Viva Connections at an event:** Kick off the announcement about the availability of Viva Connections at an all-hands or Town Hall meeting where everyone in the organization attends or can view a recording later.
- **Use communication tools like SharePoint news and Viva Engage communities:** Share details about the Viva Connections launch along with any change management guidance or end-user training in an [organizational news post](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-share-news-on-your-sharepoint-sites-495f8f1a-3bef-4045-b33a-55e5abe7aed7#:~:text=In%20SharePoint%20Online%2C%20you%20can%20add%20news%20posts,instructions%20Create%20the%20news%20post%20.%20See%20More), [Viva Engage communities](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/dc806ad9-73bb-49ae-9c68-d800fd902649), and [Microsoft Teams channels](https://support.microsoft.com/office/8e7b8f6f-0f0d-41c2-9883-3dc0bd5d4cda).
- **Consider hosting training events or offering office hours:** Make sure end-users get the most from Viva Connections by offering ongoing support the first 30 days after launching.
- **Use the Viva email and poster templates:** Get a jump start on creating [communication materials for the Viva Connections launch](https://adoption.microsoft.com/viva/).

## Step 2: Announce Viva Connections

One final task is announcing Viva Connections. Communications should be engaging and interactive where possible. Ensure end users can quickly understand how this new tool improves their jobs and makes getting news and access to important resources easier than before. Emphasize that Viva Connections is a customized and personalized experience that is accessed in Microsoft Teams or through SharePoint (if the experience was created using an existing intranet home site).

### Best practices for launching Viva Connections

- Plan to engage with users where they already meet and share information (for example, if your organization already meets in Teams, plan to post in channels.)
- Reach most of your target audience by using multiple communication methods and channels.
- Continue to engage [early adopters and champions](https://adoption.microsoft.com/roles/champion/) and use their enthusiasm and expertise to engage the rest of the organization during meetings or training sessions.
- Regularly revisit success metrics over the first 90 days to track progress and learn more about how audiences engage with Viva Connections.
- Ask end users for feedback and provide multiple ways to connect so that the experience can be improved over time

## Step 3: Use champions and provide continued support

Champions are critical to the success of adoption. They're power-users with a desire to help others along the way. Often, they're closest to the business outcomes your organization is trying to realize. Empower them with our programs or become one yourself by learning in our world wide community. Use champions to help others adopt Viva Connections by providing ongoing support in training events and other learning opportunities.
