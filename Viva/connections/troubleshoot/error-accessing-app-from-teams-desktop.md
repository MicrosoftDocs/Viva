# Error accessing Viva Connections app from Teams desktop client

## Symptoms

Your organization has followed the steps to set up and start Viva Connections. However, when you try to access the Viva Connections app from the Microsoft Teams desktop client, you receive the following error message:

> Something went wrong. We couldn’t sign you in. If the error persists, contact your system administrator and provide error code CAA20004.

**Note:** This issue occurs only when you access the Viva Connections app from the Teams desktop client. You will not see this error if you access the Viva Connections app from the Teams web client.

## Cause

This error occurs if a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part is added to Viva Connections. Because of the web part addition, the **SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal** object that’s available under **Azure Active Directory** > **App Registrations** is not configured correctly to trust the Teams desktop client.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, add the app ID for the Teams desktop client to the list of authorized client applications in Azure Active Directory:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.  Select **Azure Active Directory** > **App Registrations**.
3. Select **All Applications**.
4. Select **SharePoint Online Client Extensibility Web Application Principal**.
5. Select **Expose an API**.
6. Select **Add a client application**.
7. Enter the Teams client app ID of 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 and a scope value of 1.
