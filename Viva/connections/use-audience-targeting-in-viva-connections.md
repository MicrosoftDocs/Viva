# Use audience targeting in Viva Connections to personalize the experience

Audience targeting can help you target content to specific [Microsoft 365 Groups](/microsoft-365/community/all-about-groups) within your organization so your content is seen by the right people. Audience targeting can be applied to cards on the dashboard, SharePoint news posts in the Feed, and links in the Resource section. For example, if a regional finance department has many specialized dashboard cards needed for their daily tasks, audience targeting ensures that only members of that group see the cards.

You can also create separate Viva Connections experiences for different audiences. For more information, see the article on the [difference between audience targeting and different experiences](set-up-admin-center.md#when-to-use-a-separate-experience-vs-dashboard-card-level-targeting).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Audience targeting filters content and is not a security measure. It is not meant to manage permissions, access, or secure confidential content.
> - [Microsoft Entra Groups](/microsoft-365/community/all-about-groups) (including ecurity groups, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Microsoft Entra Dynamic Groups) are supported.
> - The author will be able to view all content in Edit mode. In read-mode, the content will be filtered based on the audiences selected.
> - Publish (or republish) to save changes made to existing page content, page metadata, and audience targeting settings for audience targeting features to take effect.

## Apply audience targeting to cards in the dashboard

Create a personalized experience by targeting dashboard cards to specific audiences to ensure only the most relevant cards are seen.â€¯Use audience targeting:

- To create custom views for distinct roles and regions,

- To generate as many different views as needed to create unique experiences, and

- To ensure the most important content is seen by the intended audience.

 [Follow these instructions if you're setting up the Viva Connections dashboard for the first time.](create-dashboard.md)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You must be a site owner of the [SharePoint home site](/viva/connections/home-site-plan#what-is-a-sharepoint-home-site) to edit the Viva Connections dashboard.
> - If you are setting up the Connections dashboard for the first time, [see the article on creating a Viva Connections dashboard and adding cards](/viva/connections/create-dashboard) for more information.

> See the article on [how to edit the dashboard from SharePoint](/viva/connections/create-dashboard#how-to-edit-the-dashboard-from-sharepoint-when-you-have-a-home-site) if you are accessing Viva Connections from your SharePoint home site.

1. From the dashboard, select **Edit**.

2. Select **Edit** on the card you want to apply audience targeting to.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connections/edit-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the edit icon":::

5. Select **audiences to preview as**. Be sure to preview the experience for each audience on desktop and mobile devices.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you've selected an audience group that you recently created or changed, it may take some time to see targeting applied for that group.

6. While in preview-mode, make sure:

    - No physical gaps appear between cards while previewing different audiences and devices. If you see gaps, rearrange cards so that every audience and device has a high-quality viewing experience.

    - Icons, graphics, and images are easy to identify and understand.

    - Buttons and links are active and go to their intended destinations.

    - Labels and description text are helpful, easy to read, and make sense for the intended audience.

7. Publish the dashboard when you're done for the audience targeting to take effect. An icon appears on the card indicating audience targeting is applied.

## Apply audience targeting to news posts that will display in the feed  

Audience targeting is useful when you want to present information that is relevant only to a particular group of people. For example, you can target news stories about a specific project to only team members and stakeholders of the project.

To use audience targeting, you must first enable audience targeting for each pages library that contains the news stories you wish to target. For more information, see the article on [enabling audience targeting for your pages library](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165#bkmk_audiencetarget).

On **November 5, 2024**, support for the feed for Viva Connections web part and video news links will end and no longer display content.

> Site owners are encouraged to use the [News](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c2dcee50-f5d7-434b-8cb9-a7feefd9f165#bkmk_sitenews), [Viva Engage](https://support.microsoft.com/office/a53cfa0c-3d09-42c8-a286-1038a81c59da#highlights), [File and Media](/stream/streamnew/portals-single-video), and [Highlighted content](/stream/streamnew/portals-set-of-videos) web parts, and [Video pages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/7823449f-e2cc-48d2-bda7-2ee82518958a) as alternatives to using the feed for Viva Connections web part and the video news link.
