# Use audience targeting in Viva Connections to personalize the experience

Learn more about the ways audience targeting can be used to make sure the right audiences see the right content in [Viva Connections](viva-connections-overview.md). Audience targeting can be applied to the three components that make up Viva Connections – the dashboard, the Feed, and the Resources.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Audience targeting filters content but is not meant to manage permissions, access, or secure confidential content.
> - [Azure Active Directory groups](/microsoft-365/community/all-about-groups) (including security groups, Microsoft 365 groups, and AAD dynamic groups) are supported.
> - While in edit-mode, the author will be able to view all content. In read-mode, the content will be filtered based on the audiences selected.  
> - Publish (or republish) to save changes made to existing page content, page metadata, and audience targeting settings for audience targeting features to take effect.  
> - If you've selected an audience group that you recently created or changed, it may take some time to see targeting applied for that group.

## How audience targeting works for each component

|Dashboard   |Feed  |Resources   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Audience targeting can be applied to cards on the dashboard.       |  Audience targeting can be applied to SharePoint news posts that display in the Feed.         |   Audience targeting can be applied to links that display in Resources.      |

## Apply audience targeting to cards in the dashboard

Create a personalized experience by targeting dashboard cards to specific audiences to ensure only the most relevant cards are seen. Use audience targeting to create custom views for distinct roles and regions, generate as many different views as needed to create unique experiences, and to ensure the most important content is seen by the intended audience. [Follow these instructions if you are setting up the Viva Connections dashboard for the first time.](create-dashboard.md)

   **While in preview-mode, make sure:** 

   - There aren’t any physical gaps between cards that may appear while previewing different audiences and devices. If you see gaps, rearrange cards so that every audience and device will have a high-quality viewing experience. 
   - Icons, graphics, and images are easy to identify and understand. 
   - Buttons and links are active and go to their intended destinations. 
   - Labels and description text are helpful, easy to read, and make sense for the intended audience.
