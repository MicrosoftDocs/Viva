# Connection: Viva Engage and Viva Connections

Support a more inclusive work culture with spaces for conversations, company news, and shared interests with Viva Connections and Viva Engage. [Using them together](/viva/experience-connection#viva-connections-and-viva-engage-better-together) boosts discoverability and engagement.

## Viva Connections

Viva Connections is an employee experience app in Microsoft Teams that connects employees with tools, news, and resources. Content in the experience is tailored to the individual based on their role, region, and interests. Viva Connections is composed of three main parts: the dashboard, feed, and resources. Viva Connections integrates with other Viva experiences by surfacing content in the feed and through cards on the dashboard. For example, conversations from Viva Engage will surface in the Viva Connections feed. Additionally, in the example below, a dashboard card surfaces an entry point into the Viva Engage app.

Viva Connections is:

* A branded app experience in Microsoft Teams that is optimized to enable experiences for information workers and frontline workers.
* A gateway to employee experiences, with the ability for you to curate the content and tools you want to deliver through quick access to data and tasks, relevant news, communications, people, and resources.
* Built on existing capabilities in Microsoft 365 like SharePoint, Teams, Yammer, and Stream.

## Viva Connections and Viva Engage: Better together

Viva Engage and Viva Connections can work together to surface relevant content and to empower employees to contribute, collaborate, work, and share. For example, one way an employee can discover a meaningful conversation is by seeing a conversation surfaced from Viva Engage in the  Viva Connections Feed. The Viva Connections Feed features relevant content from Viva Engage, including announcements, mentions (@ mentions), and storyline posts from people you follow. The Viva Connections feed includes content from other sources as well, including SharePoint news.
