# Connection: Viva Engage and Viva Connections

Support a more inclusive work culture with spaces for conversations, company news, and shared interests with Viva Connections and Viva Engage. [Using them together](/viva/experience-connection#viva-connections-and-viva-engage-better-together) boosts discoverability and engagement.

## Viva Connections

Viva Connections is an employee experience app in Microsoft Teams that connects employees with tools, news, and resources. Content in the experience is tailored to the individual based on their role, region, and interests. Viva Connections is comprised of three main parts - the dashboard, feed, and resources. Viva Connections integrates with other Viva experiences by surfacing content in the feed as well as through cards on the dashboard. For example, conversations from Viva Engage will surface in the Viva Connections feed. Additionally, in the example below, a dashboard card surfaces an entry point into the Viva Engage app.
