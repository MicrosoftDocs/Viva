# Manage skills library

You can manage your skills library by adding and deleting skills from the default skills library. You can import, export, and delete skills from your custom skill library. You can also control whether skills are available for users.


## Manage where skills are available and skills suggestions

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/featureexplorer), select **Settings**, and then select **Viva**.  
2. Select **Manage skills library**, and then select **Settings**. 
3. Select **Skills library** in the Settings tab to view and manage availability of skills in your organization.  

   1. Select **Turn on skills library** to make the skills library available in your users' profiles.
   
      Clear **Turn on skills library** to turn off skills. Users won't be able to search for and add new skills or receive skills suggestions. They'll still have access to their confirmed and dismissed skills.

   3. Select **Turn on skills in Viva Insights** (if available in your tenant) to send skills data to Viva Insights. Learn more about the [skills landscape report in Viva Insights](/viva/insights/advanced/introduction-to-advanced-insights).

5. Select **Skill suggestions** to see details about the settings. Users receive **skill suggestions** relevant to their role by default.  

    When skill suggestions are enabled, users have the option to turn it off for themselves in their skill settings. When skill suggestions are turned off, users don't see any suggested skills and can only manually confirm skills from a list. 

    If you need to disable skill suggestions for specific users, groups, or your entire tenant, create an access control policy. For more information, see [control access to features in Viva](../feature-access-management.md).

## Manage your organization’s skills library 

Your skills library is managed in two parts. You can add and delete skills you’ve selected from the default skills library in Viva, and you can reimport custom skills.  

### Manage default skills library in Viva  

View and manage the skills you selected from the default skills library in Viva. The more skills you include from the default library, the more specific suggestions users see in their skills profiles. Our recommendation is to use all 7,000+ skills, with a minimum of 500 skills.


1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/featureexplorer), select **Settings**, and then select **Viva**.  
2. Select **Manage skills library**. Select the **Skills library** tab, and then select **Skills library in Viva**. 
3. Review the list. You can filter by domain and search by skill name.
4. To add skills, select **+ Add Skills**. Select the skills you want to add. You can filter by domain and search by skill name. Select **Add**.  
5. To delete skills, select the skills you want to delete. You can filter by domain and search by skill name. Select **Delete skills**. Select **Delete** again to confirm you want to delete the selected skills. 

   Deleting skills immediately removes the skills and associated skills data from your organization and from your users' experience.

6. Select **Done**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If your library is published for users, the changes are reflected within 24 hours in their experience.  

### Manage custom skills 

Manage your custom skills library and role-to-skills mapping import. If you didn't import custom skills as a part of your initial setup, you can add it later. This step is optional if you’ve selected skills from the default skills library in Viva.

#### Import custom skills library  

Follow these steps to either import your custom skills library for the first time or to reimport with changes to your initial custom import.

> [!NOTE]
> - Reimporting custom skills library overwrites existing data. New skills will be added to your library. Deleted skills and any data associated with those skills will be deleted. Any updates to skill name or skill description will be reflected in the user's experience.
> - The admin completing custom import must have permissions to view and edit the uploaded .csv files in SharePoint.
