# Overview of Skills in Viva 

 Skills in Viva is an AI-powered service in the Microsoft Viva Suite that delivers personalized skills-based experiences throughout supported Microsoft 365 and Viva applications for employees, business leaders, and HR. 

It uses data from Microsoft 365 profiles and the [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview) combined with skills from the [LinkedIn Skills Graph](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/building-linkedin-s-skills-graph-to-power-a-skills-first-world) to predict a user’s skills and offer tailored skill suggestions to users, while providing you with a better understanding of your organization’s current workforce skills distribution. Learn more about [Skills in Viva](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/introducing-ai-powered-skills-in-microsoft-viva-a-new-way-to/ba-p/3947844). 


If you’d like to learn more or apply for the Skills in Viva preview, contact your Microsoft representative. 

## Prerequisites 

To help ensure a productive preview that enables Skills in Viva to meet and exceed your company's goals, the following are the requirements for private preview participation: 

- Private preview must be deployed on a production tenant where users are spending at least 80% of their time on emails, documents, and other Microsoft 365 and Viva applications. 
- More than 100 users who are licensed for either Viva Suite or Viva Learning.  
- EnUsers included in the Skills preview program have Viva Learning deployed and available for use.

> [!NOTE]
> - Private preview is available only in English (en-US). The default language for Viva Learning must also be English (en-US) for this preview 
> - When you enable skills, all users in your tenant lose “Interests” they have selected in Viva Learning. The interests data is deleted - users instead see skills. You cannot reverse this action.
