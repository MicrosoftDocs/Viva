# Use organizational data in the Microsoft Copilot Dashboard

If you've configured [Organizational Data in Microsoft 365](organizational-data.md), you can view and use your organizational data in the [Copilot Dashboard](insights/org-team-insights/delegate-access.md) (as long as you've got a Microsoft Copilot license). Use the following information to configure and manage organizational data for the Copilot Dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> To see data in the Copilot Dashboard, you need either 100 Microsoft Copilot licenses or 10 Viva Insights license.

Your configuration experience with Organizational Data in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Copilot depends on whether you're configuring organizational data for the first time or if you've previously set it up and are now adding Microsoft Copilot into your infrastructure.

## New customers with a Microsoft Copilot license (who've never imported organizational data)

The first time you (as a tenant admin) open Organizational Data in Microsoft 365, you see a message about checking your licensing. Once your license is verified, the feature is provisioned - this can take up to one hour, at which point you can upload custom organization data.

After the experience has been provisioned and loaded, you see the following screen: 

:::image type="content" source="media/orgdata-copilot-2.jpg" lightbox="media/orgdata-copilot-2.jpg" alt-text="A screenshot of the data attributes landing page without any data.":::

By default, because this is your first time using Organizational Data in Microsoft 365 (meaning you haven't already imported your organization's data), you see data from Microsoft Entra ID. (But this can take up to five days post-provisioning.)

Until you import organizational data, the Copilot Dashboard uses the data from Microsoft Entra ID. A yellow banner on the organizational data page indicates the source for the Copilot Dashboard data. See [Prepare and import your organizational data](organizational-data.md#prepare-and-import-your-organizational-data) for the steps to import your data.

To make sure you have the highest quality and freshest data to power your Copilot Dashboard reports, upload your organization's data. Go to the **Data imports** tab to import your organizational data.

The first time that you upload organization data, you *must* include the **Microsoft_ManagerEmail** and **Microsoft_Organization** attributes for all users for data to be used as a part of Copilot Dashboard reports (These attributes are optional for tenants without Microsoft Copilot.) 

On subsequent uploads if you choose to upload *either* **Microsoft_ManagerEmail** or **Microsoft_Organization**, at least 95% of your users must have data for those attributes. If not, the upload fails. If you choose to *omit* those two attributes, the upload succeeds, and you see the new data in the Copilot Dashboard. 

For the best experience using the Copilot Dashboard, it’s recommended that you upload ManagerID and Organization for all your employees. 

It can take up to five days to process, validate, and load your data into the Copilot Dashboard. Once the data is validated, you can see the uploaded data in the **Data overview** section as follows:  

:::image type="content" source="media/orgdata-copilot-5.jpg" lightbox="media/orgdata-copilot-5.jpg" alt-text="A screenshot of the data attributes page with the tenant's organizational data.":::


If importing your data fails, you see a warning message in the portal. Try the upload again.

## Existing Organizational Data in Microsoft 365 customers who've added a Microsoft Copilot license
If you’ve previously uploaded organization data and now have access to the Copilot Dashboard, your previous uploads aren't immediately used to power the Copilot Dashboard. The first time you see the Copilot Dashboard, it defaults to using Microsoft Entra ID data (and can take up to five days to show any data). If you want to use your organizational data instead of the Microsoft Entra ID data in the dashboard, reimport your organizational data.

## Customers with both Viva Insights or Viva Suite *and* Microsoft Copilot licenses  

If you have both a Viva Insights or Viva Suite license and a Microsoft Copilot license, when you upload organizational data, it's [shared with Viva Insights to use in the Copilot Dashboard](insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard.md). See [File rules and validation errors](insights/advanced/admin/rules-validation-errors.md) for information about the rules and validation errors for this upload.
