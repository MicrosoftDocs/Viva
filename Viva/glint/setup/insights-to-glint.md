The following procedure requires these roles: 
- **Microsoft 365 Global Administrator** to consent to share Viva Insights data with Viva Glint. 
- **Viva Glint Administrator** to set up the integration and add the relevant metrics from Viva Insights.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This feature is currently available to public preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.
>
>Also, please be advised of a current limitation in the Glint admin UI: *All* Viva Insights purchased license counts are showing instead of only the applied/deployed license counts.
>
Glint customers can import behavioral data from Microsoft Viva Insights to supplement their Viva Glint survey data for a better understanding of how your organization’s way of working impacts the employee experience.

-	Filter employee sentiment by ways of working
-	Control who can access Viva Insights data

To use this integration:

This article discusses how to import survey results – employee-level survey responses, question/item text, question/item labels, categories, survey names, rating scales, and survey closed date – from Viva Glint into Viva Insights. 

## Integration workflow 

1. The **Microsoft 365 Global Administrator** consents to share Viva Insights data with Viva Glint. [Learn more about how to start the process](/viva/insights/advanced/admin/export-insights-data-glint).

2. The **Viva Glint Administrator** sets up the integration and adds the relevant metrics from Viva Insights. [Learn more about this step](/viva/glint/setup/insights-to-glint).

## To resync the data to pick up the Microsoft Entra ID changes: 

If you see discrepancies between Glint active users and you Microsoft Entra IDs in MAC, remedy the discrepancies by following the guidelines in [Prerequisites to the integration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2280859#prerequisites-to-the-integration) section on the Viva Glint and Viva Insights integration overview page.

- In manage integration: delete all attributes and remove all programs. 
- Re-add the attributes and program to re-import Viva Insights data for all survey cycles. 

In the future, expect this resync to happen automatically.

## Manage data sharing 

On your first visit to the Viva Insights Integrations platform, accessible from your admin configuration dashboard, you see a window requesting you to review and agree to this information:

- Data sharing from Viva Insights to Viva Glint is a feature governed by the Microsoft Viva Preview Agreement. 
-	When Insights-to-Glint data sharing is enabled, Insights advanced insights metrics is shared with Glint and subject to further processing by Glint. Glint stores a copy of the share Insights data, which can be deleted from Glint at any time.
-	By selecting the checkbox, you enable Insights-to-Glint data sharing and agree to the Microsoft Viva Preview Agreement.

## Set up the Viva Insights integration 

1.	From your Glint admin dashboard, select the **Configuration** symbol and then **Viva Insights** from the **Microsoft Viva Integrations** section.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-integration-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the card to access the Viva Glint and Viva Insights integration from the admin dashboard.":::

2.	Select the **Set up integration** button in the **Import Viva Insights** data section.
3.	Review the window that pops up and then select **Get Started.**

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/import-insights-popup-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Get Started importing Viva Insights data into Glint window.":::

## Add behavioral attributes from Viva Insights

In Step 1 of 2, decide which behavioral attributes to import into Glint. Attributes are numerically split into four different ranges, defined by Glint. Ranges can be customized after setup. Glint will also respect Viva Insights confidentiality thresholds on Glint reports and dashboards.

1.	Select **Add** next to an attribute to continue. You must select at least one attribute to continue.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-add-attribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add behavioral attributes from Viva Insights window.":::

2.	In the window that opens, select at least one **role** to add to this attribute. Roles are prepopulated from your User Roles configured earlier.

3.	In the **role row**, select if that role should have access to information about this attribute in their **report filters**, **report sections**, or **comment filters**. Roles without these permissions are greyed out and unavailable to select.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-add-slidey.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Select roles for this attribute window.":::

4.	Select **Save**. This attribute now shows as **Added**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-added-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Added confirmation." lightbox= "../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-added-2.png":::

5.	Continue adding attributes until you have everything you need. 
6.	**Select Programs.**

      :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-select-programs-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Select Programs button."lightbox= "../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-added-2.png":::

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Glint respects Viva Insights confidentiality thresholds on Glint reports and dashboards.

## Viva Insights metrics

Add a Viva Insights metric as an employee attribute. Assign roles for the attribute. In this example, **after-hours collaboration hours** are chosen as the Insight metric. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-add-metric.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to add an Insight metric as an attribute.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Viva Insights only runs reports from Sunday to Sunday.  This means Glint receives Viva Insights data (also referred to as *collaboration data*) on the Sunday directly before a survey start date and the last Sunday before the survey's end date. For this reason, your data is *partial,* excluding data past the last Sunday of the survey window.
>
> **Example:** A survey starting On October 8, 2024, and ending on October 15, 2024, is actually pushed to Glint on October 6-October 13, 2024. Push dates are inclusive of start dates and exclusive of end dates.

## Import data

In the **Select Programs and Cycles** section, import data from previous cycles and set up automatic imports for future cycles. 

1.	To continue, use the boxes to display a checkmark to select a program. You may select multiple programs.
    1.	Each cycle pulls 12 weeks of Insights data, if available.
    1.	Glint currently supports importing the selected behavioral data for the last two cycles, up to 24 months.
2.	Select **Import behaviors**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-import-behaviors-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the confirmation that behavioral attributes are added."lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-import-behaviors-2.png":::

3. This confirmation shows:

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-behaviors-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Select behaviors button.":::

4. Select **Close.**

## Manage added data

Now you’re ready to manage your integration. After closing the confirmation window, the **Set up integration** button now reads **Manage Integration**. 

Select **Manage Integration**. The **Import Viva Insights data** page opens.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-manage-insights-integration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage integration button.":::	

## Manage imported attributes

You can see the list of attributes imported. 

1. To bring in other behaviors, select **+ Add attributes** and follow the same  procedure. Attributes continue to populate in the **Imported Attributes** column.

2. Use the **ellipses** next to each behavior to open a dropdown menu, providing options for you to edit, customize, or delete.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-imported-attributes-dropdown-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Imported Attributes dropdown menu."lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/glintsights-imported-attributes-dropdown-2.png" :::	

## Edit attributes

To add or delete attributes, check or uncheck any roles or filters. Select **Save**.
