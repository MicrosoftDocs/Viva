# Targeting and excluding items in a Viva Glint survey

Survey items and questions can be targeted to a specific Distribution List.

## How do I target an individual item?

From the *Questions* page within Program Summary, follow this procedure:

First, select the three dots to the right of the question text and select **Edit Targeting** from the dropdown: 

1. Select the question for targeting to activate the three vertical ellipses to the right of that question.  
2. Select **Edit Targeting** to reveal the Targeting slider.

3. In the *Targeted lists included* section, if you have already set up your Distribution List, it will appear in a dropdown list from the Search bar. Select all the distribution lists or manually select only those you want to receive that survey item. More than one distribution list can be selected. As you select lists, they'll be added above the Search bar.
4. Select **Save Changes**.

## How do I exclude an individual item?

Use the same method as above to exclude groups, using the Targeted lists excluded section in the **Targeting** slider window.

## Create a new Distribution List 

You can create a new Distribution List, if the one you need doesn't appear in the Targeting slider window. [Follow these instructions to create a new Distribution List](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230917).
