# Targeting and excluding items in a Viva Glint survey

Survey items and questions can be targeted to a specific Distribution List.

## Target an individual item

From the *Questions* page in Program Summary, follow this procedure:

1. Select the question for targeting and activate the **three vertical ellipses** next to that question.  
2. Select **Edit Targeting** to reveal the Targeting slider.

3. In the *Targeted lists included* section, if a Distribution List is set up, it appears in a dropdown menu from the Search bar. Select all the Distribution Lists or manually select those to receive that survey item. More than one Distribution List can be selected. As you select lists, they are added above the Search bar.
4. Select **Save Changes**.

## How do I exclude an individual item?

Use the method above to exclude groups in the **Targeting** slider window.

## Create a new Distribution List 

Create a new Distribution List if the one you need doesn't populate in the slider panel. [Follow these instructions to create a new Distribution List](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230917).
