# Create an Employee Lifecycle Exit survey

Your team reported great quarterly numbers; the customers are raving about your product; you're excited about the future and realize that it's all because of your employees. One day you open your inbox and read that your star performer is leaving. Could this have been prevented?

## Why understanding the exit experience matters

Most organizations recognize that long-term business success is connected to engaging and retaining capable and motivated team members. Turnover’s negative impact on a business is hard to ignore. Even worse, a single departure can trigger other employees to leave, resulting in compounded recruitment costs, knowledge loss, blows to productivity, and overall disruption to important business activities. 

An employee’s exit is a critical part of your organization's employee lifecycle. Without an effective exit program, you may miss the opportunity to gather feedback that helps identify triggers that may cause future employee departures. Organizations that collect exit data can use it to proactively improve the overall employee experience, resulting in better engagement, performance, and retention, as well as reduced business disruption and costs. 

Exit surveys are the first step to helping organizations understand why people leave, the experience they had as they left, and even what they're willing to do for the organization after departing.  

Consider that although an employee is no longer part of your team, they can still be a brand ambassador, singing your organization’s praises or tarnishing your reputation through negative feedback and reviews.
