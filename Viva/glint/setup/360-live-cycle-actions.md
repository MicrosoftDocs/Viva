# Viva Glint 360 live cycle management (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

Microsoft Viva Glint 360 admins have enhanced access to dashboards and settings during live 360 cycles. During live cycles, admins can track responses and edit items related to feedback providers, survey questions, competencies, schedule, and communications.

## 360 admin dashboard

During a live 360 cycle, the admin dashboard shows:

- The number of subjects that haven't invited feedback providers
- The average number of feedback providers for each subject
- The number of subjects who need to complete their self-assessment
- The number and percentage of subjects who aren't eligible for a 360 report yet
- A list of live subjects
- A list of completed subjects
- A list of opted out subjects

### Filter to a live subject

When an admin filters to a subject with a live 360 cycle, they see:

- How many feedback providers are invited
- If a self-assessment is complete
- How many feedback providers meet the confidentiality threshold
- The cycle end date

## 360 setup areas that can be edited during a live cycle

During a live cycle, 360 admins can view and edit feedback providers and edit some 360 setup areas including:

|Section   |Editable   |Not editable|
|:----------|:-----------|:------------|
|Setup     |<ul><li>Program, cycle, and display names and descriptions</li><li>Category name and description</li></ul>       |<ul><li>Add categories</li><li>Feedback provider response information</li></ul>        |

|Schedule & Communication|<ul><li>Resend the subject invite</li><li>Edit notifications that send on a future date</li><li>Change reminder timing</li><li>Extend subject due date or change cycle due dates in bulk</li><li>Close a 360 cycle</li></ul>    |<ul><li>Change dates</li><li>Edit notifications or reminders were already sent</li></ul> |

## View notification history

Notification history is available **only after** a cycle is live but isnâ€™t configurable. To view notification history:

1. In **Cycle Settings**, select **Schedule & Communication**.
2. Select **Notification History**.

## Available actions after a self-assessment is complete

After a subject completes their self-assessment, a 360 admin can:

- View if a subject completed a self-assessment
- View if the 360 report is released to the subject, manager, or coach
- View the end date of the cycle
- Edit or add a coach
- Reopen and extend the end date for a subject. Use this option when a subject doesn't have enough feedback to meet thresholds to view a report.
- If a report is generated for a subject, the admin can:
  - Download the report
  - View the online report
  - Release the report and add recipients other than the subject, manager, and coach
- Release reports in bulk based on different criteria
- Export a CSV file of all completed subjects and their coaches
- Export a CSV file of all subjects' self-assessments and feedback provider responses
- Export a CSV file of all 360 report data for subjects who are eligible for a report

## Available actions for opted out subjects

For opted out subjects, the admin can: 

- See the opt-out date
- Reopen and extend the 360 due date
- Delete the subject from the cycle
