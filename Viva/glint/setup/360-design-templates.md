# 360 program design and templates 

[Refer to this guidance for Glint best practices for customizing programs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2240920).

In addition to this guidance, there are items specific to 360 design. Viva People Scientists conducted an extensive study to identify 300+ unique work behaviors. This study resulted in the validated core items populated in the 360 template. Open-ended questions provide additional context and help the Subject prioritize developmental opportunities.
25 or less questions produce the most useful data for 360 Subjects.

## Can a 360 program be used without a competency model?

Yes. Although your org may have a competency model, it doesn’t guarantee alignment with what you consider the behaviors of a successful leader. Use the Glint 360 feedback program to establish a competency model unique to your organization.

## Use the 360 template

Start from a **Glint Manager 360 template** or a **blank 360 feedback program template**. Each program should ideally end up with individual cycles, which your organization administers over a scheduled period of time. 
Create a separate 360 feedback program if you’re planning major changes to a cycle or to create a different overall experience for individual subjects. For example: 360 programs for Managers, Executives, and Employee Resource Groups could be set up as three separate programs.

Follow this process:

1.	From the Glint admin dashboard, select the **Configuration** symbol and then **360 Feedback Programs**.
1.	Select **+ New 360 Program.** 
1.	Choose from:
  	- **Glint Manager 360 Program** - Pre-populated template with recommended questions and competencies, settings, and Glint standard content (including translations). 
      - When creating additional cycles, select **+ New Cycle.**
      - Copy a previous cycle from the ellipses **Duplicate Cycle** dropdown menu to carry over all settings.
    -	**Blank 360** - Start from scratch and choose your own items, competencies, settings, and content.
