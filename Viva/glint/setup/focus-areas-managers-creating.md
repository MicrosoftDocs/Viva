# Managers creating Focus Areas

Review your [Top Strengths and Top Opportunities](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231207), suggested action templates and their resources before meeting with your team. Preparing for your team meeting is the best way to solicit insightful and productive Focus Areas to act on. 

> [!TIP]
> Work on one Focus Area at a time in order to ensure the maximum effort toward taking one step forward.

## Prep for your team conversation

> [!NOTE]
> Admins can customize the names of terms such as “Focus Areas.” Your company may, for example, opt for this tab to read “Actions” or "Goals." Be aware that you may not see exactly the same wording on your tabs, section names, and text snippets as described in this guidance.

There are two ways to enter the Focus Areas section:

- From your Glint dashboard - Select the **Focus Areas** tab from the top menu bar and then **My Focus Areas** on the page that opens. 
- From your [Manager Concierge](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231115) timeline, if enabled. In Step 4 - Select **Choose a Focus Area.**  ​​​​​​

**Review the [Manager Quick Guide to Results and Conversation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2273507).**

### Select Focus Areas with your team

1. From the *Creating a New Focus Area* page, review the items available for your team to work on.
   1. Select **Choose** to see suggested actions and resources for each Focus Area.
   1. Review and consider as many Focus Areas as you believe might be helpful and elicit support from your team. Preview *Suggested Actions and Resources* by hovering over the title and selecting it. Each Suggested Action has a default selection, listed first.
   1. When it comes time to commit to a Focus Area and add actions and resources, you can attach as many as you would like onto your action plan.

2. If your role has Manager Concierge enabled, in Step 3, select **Download Presentation Kit.** The presentation kit was configured by your admin to help you facilitate a meaningful and insightful conversation with your team.
   1. Customize the Presentation Kit to get ready for your team meeting.
   1. Make notes on each slide that will be helpful to you. 

## Committing to a Focus Area with your team - Manager without Team Conversations 

Once your survey has closed:

1. Share survey results with your team, following your Presentation Kit guidance and using [ACT best practices](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2234345) for extra support.
1. Share your Creating a New Focus Area screen with your team. You can also customize the presentation kit to highlight these possibilities.
1. Choose as many of Suggested Actions and Suggested Resources as desired. Select **+ Add to Focus Area** for each.
1. Save to your team’s plan by selecting **Create Focus Area.** You now see your new plan on the Focus Areas tab.

## Committing to a Focus Area with your team - Managers with Team Conversations

Once your survey has closed, you can complete this task directly from your Presentation Kit, in real-time, with your team. There are two ways to begin this process:

- In Step 3 of Manager Concierge, the link previously titled Download Presentation Kit is updated to Launch Team Conversation. Select **Launch Team Conversation** and then **Get Started.** Review the slides and when you are ready to present, select **Start Conversation.**
- You receive an email letting you know that your interactive presentation is ready to share with your team. Select **Get Started** to work with your team to choose a Focus Area.

## The *Choose a Focus Area* slide 

Switch from Opportunities, Strengths, and Other to share possibilities for improvement with your team. Use the **Choose** button to cue up Glint Suggested Actions and Resources. 

- Scroll down to see the suggestions.
- Switch back and forth between drivers before settling on a Focus Area. Selecting **Remove** next to the item you are viewing, and then **Choose** next to another driver to consider.
- When your team agrees on their next step, select **+ Add Action Item** to add suggested actions and resources to the plan you are developing together.
- Select **Commit to Focus Area.** This information becomes part of your Small Steps Forward slide. Step 3 on *Manager Concierge* indicates completion by displaying a checkboard. The link in Step 4 now reads “View Focus Area.” You can access the link at any time.

## Edit a Focus Area plan

Update or edit a Focus Area by selecting the **+ New Focus Area** button on the *My Focus Areas* page or **View Focus Area** (for managers with Team Conversations enabled). Select **Edit** option next to the driver. Choose another driver by selecting **Choose**.

Remove a Focus Area by selecting Delete from the vertical ellipsis next to it on the My Focus Areas page.

## View a Focus Area status

After a Focus Areas is chosen, Focus Area status can be seen on the *My Focus Areas* page. Select a detail from the Focus Area row to open the *Viewing Your Focus Areas* page. More detailed information is available here and editing can occur. 

### Change the Status of a Focus Area plan

Open the Viewing Your Focus Areas page in either of these two ways:

- From your Glint dashboard: Select **Focus Areas**  and then **My Focus Areas.**
- From the Glint [Team Summary dashboard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231210), select **View Focus Area** from Step 4 in *Manager Concierge*.

You can change the status of these items:

- Focus Area Status Tracker 
  - Indicate if Focus Area progress is Not Done, Off Track, On Track, or Complete.
  - Note: This area is updated manually. Even if a team hasn't achieved the Focus Area, a manager may decide to indicate Complete, indicating that the team is ready to move on to another opportunity. This functionality isn't driven by the status of Action Items completion.
- Time Period
  - Indicates the start date for the time period assigned to work on the Focus Area.
- Visibility
- Action Items - After Suggested Actions are selected and appear in the *Action Items* section, a manager can keep track of team progress by activating the checkmark to indicate completion.
- Comments - As a manager and their team work toward a Focus Area, they can make notes of progress or roadblocks.
- Tag someone by name to get feedback or input from a specific person around a Focus Area. This also calls it out to a specific manager to consider using for their own team.

## Reordering Focus Areas

To help focus and prioritize your attention, you can reorder focus areas from the **My Focus Areas** page. Hover over the card to be moved until a blue bar appears. Drag the blue bar to a new position.
