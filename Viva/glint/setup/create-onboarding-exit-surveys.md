# Create Viva Glint Onboarding and Exit survey programs

Microsoft Viva Glint believes that ongoing, frequent communications to solicit and collect employee feedback is crucial to an organization’s success. Viva Glint offers programs as a way for customers to send short, targeted surveys to their employees, which will deliver rich insights that translate into actionable opportunities to improve business.

Employee Lifecycle programs – Onboarding and Exit - provide data about how a new hire feels about their introduction to your organization and its culture and collects information about why an employee has voluntarily left your organization.

Our Viva People Science team continually updates Viva Glint survey templates so that they're always relevant in the current world of work.

## Creating a people-centric organization begins with Onboarding

We have all been new employees at one time or another. We start with excitement for the future, anticipation of challenges to come, and desire for belonging with new colleagues. With effective people practices, hopes can become a reality, and we can go on to become happy and successful in our new roles. Successful onboarding experiences can increase new hires’ self-efficacy, role clarity, social integration, and learning in the short-term, and can increase performance, retention, and organizational commitment.

## Why is onboarding so important? 

Research shows it typically takes 12 months for new hires to reach their full performance potential, but many organizations continue to think of onboarding as just a few events, often focusing on orientation and risk early disengagement and undesirable attrition. 

- 56% of newly onboarded employees are likely to consider changing jobs within a year (Microsoft 2022 Work Trend Index) 
- 30% of new hires have left a job in first 90 days 
- With the “Great Reshuffle” trend, many people are rethinking where, when, and why they work 

This information creates a unique opportunity for organizations to rethink their onboarding experience to direct their new hires’ excitement and curiosity to sustainable, positive outcomes.

## Why understanding the Exit experience matters

Your team reported great quarterly numbers; the customers are raving about your product; you're excited about the future and realize that it's all because of your employees. One day you open your inbox and read that your star performer is leaving. Could this have been prevented?

Most organizations recognize that long-term business success is connected to engaging and retaining capable and motivated team members. Turnover’s negative impact on a business is hard to ignore. Even worse, a single departure can trigger other employees to leave, resulting in compounded recruitment costs, knowledge loss, blows to productivity, and overall disruption to important business activities. 

An employee’s exit is a critical part of the employee lifecycle. Without an effective exit program, you may miss the opportunity to gather feedback that helps identify triggers that may cause future employee departures. Organizations that collect exit data can use it to proactively improve the overall employee experience, resulting in better engagement, performance, and retention, as well as reduced business disruption and costs. 

Exit surveys are the first step to helping organizations understand why people leave, the experience they had as they left, and even what they're willing to do for the organization after departing.  

Consider that although an employee is no longer part of your team, they can still be a brand ambassador, singing your organization’s praises or tarnishing your reputation through negative feedback and reviews.
