# Manage language translations in Viva Glint programs 

English is the default language for all Microsoft Viva Glint programs, but surveys and email communications should be sent to employees in their preferred language. Viva Glint provides customers with more than 70 language translations for standard program content. Language translations are set during the initial survey configuration or added later as needed. Exporting a file that includes the default language and all relevant translations allows reviewing, adding, or editing translations to happen in one place. 

Translations may be needed for email communications and survey content such as single-item questions, statements, multiple-choice questions, rating labels, and text snippets.  

There are four steps for making language translations: 

1. Export content from the Viva Glint program into a *.csv* or *.xlsx* file 
2. Translate content 
3. Review translations 
4. Import content back into the Viva Glint program 

## Export survey and email text 

Follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to the appropriate survey program. 
2. From the Actions dropdown menu and, select **Export Program Content**. 
3. Choose if you'll export email content, survey content, or both.  
4. Select the languages you would like to export from the Languages to include section. Default text will already be included in addition to whatever additional languages are chosen. 
5. Select **Generate CSV**. 
6. From the file generated, make translations to import back into Viva Glint. 

>[!NOTE]
> The email content will be downloaded as its own separate Excel document. Survey content will download as a zip file with one file containing survey questions and text snippets.

>[!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint system requires that one language document is initially exported and then later imported back into the program before the process can be repeated for other languages.
