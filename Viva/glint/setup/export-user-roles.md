# Export User Roles from the People feature

Admins can export lists of members associated with specific roles and attributes. This functionality is especially useful for large teams. Export these User Role lists from the People section on your admin dashboard.  

All exports generate a .csv download. Downloads may take a few minutes, dependent upon list size.
