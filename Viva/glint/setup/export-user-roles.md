# Export and import Viva Glint User Role members

Viva Glint Administrators can export lists of members associated with specific roles from the People page and import users in User Roles.

## View User Roles on the People page

The left-most column shows all User Roles set up for your organization. 

## Export an individual role

All exports generate a .csv download. Downloads may take a few minutes, depending on the number of members.

1. Select a User Role and then select **Export**.

5. The .csv report includes first and last names, email address, and employee status. Choose whether to include all user attributes and User Roles.
6. Select  **Export**.
7. After following these steps, you'll receive a "Report Downloaded" message in a new browser tab.

## Import users to a User Role

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Importing a list of users to a User Role removes attribute rules that automatically add users based on their attribute values.

1. As a Viva Glint Admin, go to **Configuration** and select **User Roles** in the **Employees section.
2. Select a User Role to update.
3. On the role's detail page, select **Add/Edit Employees**.
4. In the dialog that appears, select the **Import** option.
  
   :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/add-employees-role-modal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog that appears when a user adds members to a User Role.":::

5. In the **Import Employees to role** dialog that appears, select Download CSV to download a list of users that are in the User Role.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/import-to-role-modal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog that appears when a user selects the Import option to add users to a role.":::

6. A .csv file downloads to your device with an **email** column. Add or remove email addresses for users that should leave or join this role. Save the edited file as .csv or .xlsx.
   1. Users in this file must already have a record in Viva Glint and the email address added to the User Role file must match their email in Viva Glint.
8. In the User Role **Import Employees to role** dialog, drag and drop to upload or browse to choose your list of users for this role.
   1. Select **Preserve the employees already in this role** to keep existing users
   2. Deselect **Preserve the employees already in this role** to replace all existing users with the users in the uploaded file.
9. Select **Import File.**
10. In the **Confirm your import** dialog that appears, review the summary of changes and select **Confirm Import ** or **Cancel**.

11. Return to the User Role details page and check that the number of members decreased or increased as expected.
