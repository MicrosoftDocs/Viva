# Create a new 360 cycle (preview)

After choosing the Glint Manager 360 Program template or the blank template, select **+New Cycle**.

2. Use the **pencil icon** to name your copied template. Give cycles unique names in order to differentiate between them. Only admins see cycle names. Cycle names donâ€™t appear on the user interface or on reports.
3. The new cycle displays in the *Cycle Name* column.
