# Use Viva Glint's People page to view employee information

The People page functionality allows admins to view employee attributes, manage permissions and roles, and deactivate employees. 

The  **People** section is accessed from the  **Employees** section on the admin dashboard and allows admins to: 

- View individual employee data  
- Manage positions by assigning User Roles 
- Manage employment status 
- Import an employee file 
- Export a file of active employees 

## Use the filter feature   

Employees are filtered by active/inactive status and User Role. 

### All People  

A count of present and past employees, listed by: 

- Active: Working within your organization presently 
- Inactive: No longer work within your organization or are currently on leave
- Support Users: External users that have been added by your organization to provide assistance
- Advanced Configuration Access: Company Admin users with access to Advanced Configuration

### User Roles 

A count of company admins, managers, Human Resource Business Partners (HRBPs), and HR business partners listed by User Roles. 

## Find information on a specific person 

Use one of the two following methods: 

- Begin to type the name of the employee in the search bar. When the name appears, select the name.   
- Scroll down the alphabetized list of names, but with hundreds or thousands of employees, that method won't be as efficient! 

For each employee, the following information is visible: 

- Employee Name: Editable by admin by selecting the pencil symbol. 
- Email: Editable by admin by selecting the pencil symbol. 
- Employee ID: Not editable. 
- Manager Hierarchy: The organization’s highest-ranking employee (generally the CEO) is listed first. The hierarchy progresses downward, following the organizational chart flow, ending with the employee’s immediate manager. Not editable. 
- User Role(s): Determines what data and people for whom this user has visibility. Editable by selecting the pencil symbol. 
- Attributes and hierarchies (aside from the primary hierarchy, usually Manager): As defined in your organization’s latest Employee Data File. The Attributes section of an individual’s People page will always include required attributes (like Employee ID) and then customized attributes, as defined in your Employee Data File. 

For employees with User Roles in addition to Active Employees, the following editable information will also appear: 

- Focus Area Access: Defines which people's data this user will see in Focus Area reports. Editable by selecting the pencil symbol.  
- Survey Access: Defines which people's data this user can see in selected survey programs. Editable by selecting the pencil symbol.

>[!CAUTION]
> Viewing and exporting raw data are governed by Microsoft rules protecting employee confidentiality. Review the guidance on [raw data exports](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2239587) within our Security and Privacy documents.

## Use the View As function 

The View As functionality allows you to open your Viva Glint program as if you were another employee. This functionality allows you to view another user’s dashboard based on their User Role and data access.

**To view as another person**: 

1. Locate the person you want to view as and open their page by hovering over and selecting the name. 

1. Select  **View As**. 

1. The dashboard indicates “You are seeing `<other person name>` Viva Glint experience." 

To return to your own account, select  **Return to your account**. 

## Use the Actions function 

The Actions button dropdown menu allows you to send surveys, send user data, and delete users.

### Send Survey 

You can send a survey to one employee (manually) from the People page. Use the Actions button and then  **Send Survey**. 

- Enabled and live surveys are displayed. Select the survey to send.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >A survey will not appear if it is not enabled or live. Go back into the program to re-enable or change the date of the survey, noting that it will take a few minutes for a survey to become live.

- Select  **Send**.

### Send User Data

Send a user's survey response and attributes directly to a user, without viewing data. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230875).

### Delete User

Delete a user from Viva Glint. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236554).

## Import your Employee Data File 

Use the  **Import**  button on the People page to import a *.csv* (UTF-8 encoded) or an *xlsx* (single tab) file to update employee details.

Follow the on-screen guidance for uploading the file and then select  **Import File**. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230742).

   > [!NOTE]
   >If you upload a user file during a live survey, employee information will not be altered for that survey. 


## Export an Active Employees report 

To make changes to an employee file, it's often easier to start with what's in the system first, so exporting from within the system, making changes, and then reimporting can occur beginning with the Export feature. 

Select **Export** and then follow the on-screen guidance.
