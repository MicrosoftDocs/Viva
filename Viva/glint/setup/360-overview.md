# Viva Glint 360 feedback program overview 

The Microsoft Viva Glint 360 feedback program and process give insight into a manager's strengths and opportunities with a specific, long-term focus on improvement.

## 360 feedback process

The Viva Glint 360 Feedback process gives employees insight into their strengths and opportunities from various viewpoints. Rather than relying solely on the perspective of an immediate supervisor or manager, 360s invite multiple perspectives. 

360s are also known as multi-rater feedback, multisource feedback, or multisource assessments. 

**Research shows that 85% of people struggle with self-awareness - even though 95% of people believe they are self-aware.** The goal of a 360 is to increase self-awareness about key strengths, uncertainties, and the impact a leader has on others. Results identify opportunities to improve. 360s are a foundational step to professional growth and meaningful change. A 360 isn't a performance evaluation but is focused on a participant’s development.

## 360 feedback program 

The 360 program is a set of related measures with a specific, long-term focus. Program components include real-time survey analysis, engagement metrics, employee lifecycle, and focus area management techniques. 

A program contains at least one 360 cycle. A program could, however, include cycles focusing on a specific program theme. The number of 360 programs you can set is unlimited.

Glint offers a 360 Feedback program template designed for managers.
