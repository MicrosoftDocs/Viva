# Viva Glint's Quarterly Engagement Survey template

Microsoft Viva Glint saw a shift in focus on what is most important to the happiness and success of employees since the mid-2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global factors. For this reason, we knew we needed to reexamine our current measures of employee engagement (2018) to ensure we're focusing on the most meaningful engagement drivers for this modern era. 

We analyzed over 350 million employee survey responses collected since 2020 to determine the employee experiences that were most predictive of engagement - happiness at work and willingness to recommend the company. We discovered some new key driver themes, which resulted in a new top-20 list of core engagement drivers. Additionally, we identified several other drivers that may be beneficial for consideration by individual organizations. 

## How we arrived at the Viva Glint Quarterly Engagement template

The result of our re-examination of the focus of engagement is a modernized framework (early 2022) called **People Success Elements. These elements are six constructs**: Purpose, Clarity, Growth, Empowerment, Connection, and Wellbeing. The constructs summarize the fundamental needs and expectations that are most critical to a personâ€™s holistic life experience (not only their work experience) and that best shape an environment for high engagement.
