# Privacy policies in Microsoft Viva Glint

Every Microsoft Viva Glint survey includes links to a privacy policy that users can access. Privacy policies within Viva Glint are accessible from:

- Email footers
- Survey login screens
- Survey introduction (welcome) pages
- Behind the question mark symbol in top navigation menu of each survey and the Viva Glint's reporting dashboard

The privacy policy can be either:

- Your organization's privacy policy if you choose to add it to Viva Glint
- The [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20a%20Microsoft%20product%20with%20an,associated%20with%20your%20Microsoft%20product%20and%20product%20accounts.) if you don't add your organization's privacy policy.

The Microsoft Privacy Statement explains the personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes. It includes a section specifically addressing personal data processing in commercial products, like Viva Glint, that users can access through an employer or other organization. Before deciding to rely solely on the Microsoft Privacy Statement, you should review it carefully and determine, in coordination with your legal, privacy, and HR teams, whether it meets your organization's needs.

Viva Glint allows your organization to present its own privacy policy to Viva Glint users. By adding your own privacy policy, you can provide more specific information to employees about how your organization handles their personal data, which may be necessary to meet your organization's compliance needs. Again, you should consult your legal, privacy, and HR teams to determine what privacy policy to include in Viva Glint.

## Use your organization's privacy policy in Viva Glint programs

The setup for the privacy policy is self-serve from within the admin dashboard.

### To add your organization's privacy policy

Follow this procedure:

1. From the admin dashboard, navigate to **General Settings** and then **Company Information**.
2. Add the link to your company's privacy policy URL in the bar in the **Company Privacy Policy** section.

Your company's privacy policy link will now be embedded on Viva Glint's top navigation menu bar, survey header, and survey introduction page. If you haven't provided a correct link, an error message directs you to enter a valid URL.

### User access to your organization's privacy policy

If your organization chose to add its privacy policy to Viva Glint, users can access it in these places:

1. Survey page: Survey takers can access it from the **privacy policy** link on survey introduction pages or by selecting the question mark symbol on the surveys' top navigation bar and then **Privacy** from the dropdown menu.
2. Viva Glint reporting dashboard: From the top navigation menu of the Viva Glint application, select the question mark symbol and then **Privacy** from the dropdown menu.

## To use the Microsoft Privacy Statement

If your organization doesn't add its privacy statement to Viva Glint, a link to the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) will automatically be presented in Viva Glint's top navigation menu bar, survey headers, and survey introduction pages.

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Privacy Statement will display in all Viva Glint email footers and login screens.
