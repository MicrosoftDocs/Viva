# Viva Glint Licensing

Subscription plans of Viva suite or Viva Glint are required for using Microsoft Viva Glint. The total number of active licenses in your subscriptions should be greater than or equal to the number of active users in the app. 

## Notifications for exceeding licenses

If the number of active users in Viva Glint exceeds the subscription purchase, you're notified via email, and you have a 45 day grace period to take one of the following actions:

- Purchase extra Microsoft Viva suite or Viva Glint licenses according to the product terms. 
- Remove excess active users from the Viva Glint instance by marking their status as "INACTIVE" in a [user upload](upload-employee-attributes.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Glint uses Microsoft’s capacity license model. Marking a user as "INACTIVE" frees up a capacity license to be used. Licenses are no longer in use when an admin inactivates users and admins don't need to assign licenses individually. 

## What happens if our grace period expires?

If the 45 day grace period expires before licenses and active users are aligned, surveys already in an approved and enabled state continue uninterrupted. Some key Viva Glint new survey creation functions don't work as expected, such as:
- survey program creation and approval
- survey cycle creation
- survey cycle enablement

>[!CAUTION]
>If a customer purchases additional licenses to remedy the license shortage, it could take up to 24 hours to re-enable survey creation features in the app.

## Global Admin purchasing more Viva Glint licenses

Only your organization's Global Admin can purchase more licenses. [Buy more licenses for a Microsoft business subscription.](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses)
