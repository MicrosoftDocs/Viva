# Viva Glint Licensing

Subscription plans of Viva suite or Viva Glint are required for using Microsoft Viva Glint. The total number of active licenses in your subscriptions should be greater than or equal to the number of active users in the app. 

> [!NOTE]
> Individual user license assigment isn't required for Viva Glint.

## Notifications for exceeding licenses

If the number of active users in Viva Glint exceeds the subscription purchase, you receive an email, and have a 45 day grace period to take one of the following actions:

- Purchase extra Microsoft Viva suite or Viva Glint licenses according to the product terms. 
- Remove excess active users from the Viva Glint instance by marking their status as "INACTIVE" in an employee data file to deactivate them during a [user upload](upload-employee-attributes.md).

## What happens if our grace period expires?

If the 45 day grace period expires before licenses and active users are aligned, surveys already in an approved and enabled state continue uninterrupted. Some key Viva Glint new survey creation functions don't work as expected, such as:
- survey program creation and approval
- survey cycle creation
- survey cycle enablement
- 360 survey program creation
- 360 survey cycle creation
- 360 survey cycle scheduling

> [!CAUTION]
> If a customer purchases additional licenses to remedy the license shortage, it could take up to 24 hours to re-enable survey creation features in the app.

## Global Admin purchasing more Viva Glint licenses

Only your organization's Global Admin can purchase more licenses. [Buy more licenses for a Microsoft business subscription.](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses)
