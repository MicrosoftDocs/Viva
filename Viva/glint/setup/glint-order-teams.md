# Viva Glint Licensing

Subscription plans of Viva suite or Viva Glint are required for using Microsoft Viva Glint. The total number of active licenses in your subscriptions should be greater than or equal to the number of active users in the app. 

## Notifications for exceeding licenses

If the number of active users in Viva Glint exceeds the subscription purchase, you'll be notified via email, and you'll have a 45-day grace period to take one of the following actions:

- Purchase extra Microsoft Viva suite or Viva Glint licenses according to the product terms; 
- Remove excess active users from the Viva Glint instance by marking them “INACTIVE.”  

If the grace period expires and you haven't taken any of the actions described above, some of Viva Glint app’s key functionalities won't work as expected. An admin can perform either of the actions to re-enable all features of Viva Glint.
