# Set up Program Summary pages for a Viva Glint engagement-type survey

The first step for setting up a Microsoft Viva Glint program is to set up **Program Summary**.

## Access Program Summary to set up a new survey

If you need help choosing a survey, [learn about survey types here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231202). 

1. From your admin dashboard, select the **Configure** symbol.
2. In the *Survey* section, choose **Survey Programs**.
3. Select **+ New Program.**
4. Choose your survey template or start from scratch with a blank template. Select **Create Program** on the corresponding card.

## Program Summary setup

In the Program Summary section, there are up to seven pages to be set up. Not all pages are needed for all programs. Only pages required for the program you have chosen are shown for you to set up. Pages for setup can include:

- [Program Summary: Program Setup](program-set-up.md)
- [Program Summary: Distribution](set-up-distribution-lists.md)
- [Program Summary: Schedule](schedule-setup.md)
- [Program Summary: Questions](questions-setup.md)
- [Program Summary: Reporting](reporting-setup.md)
- [Program Summary: Communications](program-summary-communications.md)
- [Program Summary: Coaching](program-summary-coaching.md)

A checkmark indicates that the page is set up correctly and allows you to move to the next Program Summary setup page. If you'd like to move ahead before finishing a page, add dummy data to the page. Don't forget to come back and change that dummy data to accurate information!
