# Suggested content for a Viva Glint Distress survey

When societal or global events introduce instability and disruption to our natural patterns in work and personal lives, it causes distress. COVID-19 is an example—it introduced a very personal impact on our core human needs for safety and security. Without addressing fundamental concerns, organizations cannot run “business as usual.”

**What do people need at work to remain happy and successful?**

People always need these things at work:
- They want to feel valued and confident about the future of their organization, as well as their place in it.
- They want to feel a sense of belonging.
- They want to feel trust in their leaders.
- They want to clearly understand how to be their best and do their best work.

**During times of distress, they need more.** 

People need reassurance that their leaders are prioritizing their safety and wellbeing needs. Employees have a heightened urgency to receive timely, fact-based, and candid communications about what’s happening, why, and the impact on them. They also need the opportunity to express fears and concerns and feel a sense of control over their circumstances. 

During times of change-management, uncertainty, or any overarching factor that brings a feeling of unsettlement and the unknown, consider adding Viva People Science suggested distress survey items to a scheduled engagement survey or creating an ad hoc distress survey to learn how your people are feeling and what they need.

## Instances where a distress survey will benefit your org

- Major political, social, hostile, or economic events 
- Sudden catastrophic (local or global) natural disaster events
- Disease outbreaks and pandemics
- Local disasters affecting employee populations or communities
- Any other events that cause threat and fear for some or all employees

## Choose from three different distress survey options 
When deciding whether to survey, when to do it, and how to position it, consider these options:

- **Engagement Survey** – Continue with your existing engagement survey schedule but update it to consider the current environment to receive feedback which helps shape your internal response.
- **Ad Hoc Survey** – Deliver an unscheduled survey at a pivotal time when employees need support mechanisms in place and their feedback is essential.
- **Always-On Survey** – Provide an open channel to allow employees to drop feedback in at any time.
