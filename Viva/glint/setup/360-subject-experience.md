# Viva Glint 360 feedback program - subject experience

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

A Microsoft Viva Glint 360 feedback program provides insights into your strengths and opportunities. A 360 program shares different viewpoints about the way you work from the people you work with. It’s a foundational step toward professional growth and meaningful change. A 360 is not a performance evaluation but is truly focused on your development.

Your direct manager assigns you to become a 360 program subject. As a 360 subject you complete a self-assessment and request feedback from various others such as your manager, direct reports (if you’re a people manager) and other collaborators.

Your experience:

## 3-step 360 subject journey

After accessing your 360 program, begin your three-step journey.

There are two ways to begin your 360 process:

- Select feedback providers from your welcome email.
  
  - On the cycle start date, you’ll receive a welcome email letting you know that your 360 program has begun. 
  - The email provides instructions about next steps and prompts to **Select feedback providers**.
  - Upon selecting this, you’re prompted to log into Viva Glint and brought to a page to select your feedback providers.

Your email will look like this:

::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-subject-start-email.png" lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/360-subject-start-email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the welcome email for 360 subjects.":::

- Select feedback providers from your Glint dashboard
  
  - From your Glint manager dashboard, in the Feedback tab, you’ll see that you have a 360 program in progress.
 
## Step 1 - Select feedback providers

You may see pre-populated feedback providers (manager, direct reports, peers). There’s no limit to the number of feedback providers you can select, but you must invite at least three.

::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-subject-step-1.png" lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/360-subject-step-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the first step for 360 subjects.":::

1.	Follow on-screen instructions to add or remove feedback providers. 
2.	When finished, select the Invite Feedback Providers button. 
3.	A banner confirms that your feedback providers are updated. 
4.	Feedback provider email invitations are sent within 15 minutes of you pressing the button.

### What if I haven't invited enough feedback providers?

You’ll receive on-screen direction if you haven’t met your minimum. Select **Update Feedback Providers** after you have entered enough providers.

### Feedback provider reminder

If you haven’t had time yet or have forgotten to select your feedback providers, you’ll receive this email:

## Step 2 - Take your self-assessment

From the Feedback tab on your Glint dashboard, select **View** for your program. Now Step 2 can be activated. Select the **Take Assessment** button and follow the on-screen instructions. Note that your due date for your self-assessment displays.

When you've finished, you'll see this message:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-self-thanks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the thanks for taking your self-assessment message.":::


## Step 3 - Review your report and reflect

Until your cycle is complete, Step 3 will show as *Awaiting Results*

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-awaiting-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot Step 3 in the self-assessment journey.":::

You'll see this by
 - reaccessing your initial welcome email and selecting "Select feedback providers"
 - or, from the Feedback tab on your Glint dashboard, go to **My Feedback** and then **View.**

## Access your 360 report

You’ll receive an email letting you know you can review your report. Use the button in the email or access your report directly from the Feedback tab on the Glint platform. 

1.	Scroll to the *Feedback History* section to access your completed 360.
2.	Select the report card to open the report. The card shows the number of completed participants (you included) and their initials.
3.	On the toolbar, select the horizontal ellipses to review the confidentiality settings. You can also download a PDF of your report.
4.	Choose a tab to open:
     - **Insights** – A top-level view of your 360 results
     - **Comments** – A view of all comments. Comments are intended to give context for why someone provided a specific rating.
     - **All Responses** – A detailed view of your survey questions. View in bar chart or table format.

### Visibility into your report access

You have visibility about who has access to your 360 report. In the Welcome email and 360 overview page. A message appears and you can see:
 
- Which users are scheduled to receive a copy of the 360 report (subject, coach and/or manager)
- That you'll receive an email notification when admins release your 360 report, as well as when an admin removes report access for a user.
 
From your 360 report, you have access to a Report Recipients section that lists all report recipients and release dates.
 
> [!NOTE]
> Subjects that don’t have access to their 360 reports still have visibility to view Report Recipients.

## Opt out of becoming a subject

Your manager may begin a 360 feedback program on your behalf. You can opt out by selecting the **Opt out** button in the welcome email or overview page. 
 
After selecting Opt out, confirm or cancel your action in the confirmation message that displays. The Glint 360 admin from your organization receives an email notification should you opt out.
 
If an admin reopens a cycle for a you after you have opted out, no responses are saved and the entire cycle must start over.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-opt-out.png" lightbox=""../../media/glint/setup/360-opt-out.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Opt Out option in a subject's 360 welcome email.":::

### Opting out during live or closed survey status

You can’t opt out of a closed 360 feedback cycle. You receive an error message stating the cycle is no longer available. 

Should you opt out during a cycle, any feedback already collected is deleted, and this action can’t be undone. An opt out record is retained in the subject’s *My Feedback* tab and the admin’s cycle overview. This can be overridden if an admin manually deletes the subject from the cycle.
