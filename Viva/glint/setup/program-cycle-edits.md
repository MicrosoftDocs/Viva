# Understand Viva Glint programs and cycles  

Setting up your first Viva Glint program in the manner suggested is the most efficient way to incorporate Glint into your company’s infrastructure going forward. Much of the setup is used in your upcoming (future) programs, so taking the time to build your platform and plan ahead is key. 

## Learn our terminology 

**Survey Program**: A series of surveys, also called a “pulse program.” For example, a Quarterly Engagement Survey is a survey series with invitations sent out quarterly for each survey.  

**Cycle**: One single survey within a program. 

**Tip**: We use the word “survey” most often when referring to a cycle. This term aligns best for global translation.  

**Linked**: By default, all surveys/cycles are linked, meaning that any changes made at the program level automatically apply to all future surveys in the program.  

**Unlinked**: A single survey can be edited in ways that don't affect future surveys in the same program. When edits are made to a single survey, it becomes unlinked. Edits made to an unlinked survey only affect that survey. Future surveys in the same program aren't affected. Trend data is unaffected. 

## Edit a program versus a cycle

Once an entire program has been set up, future survey cycles are edited at the program level in the [Program Summary](https://www.microsoft.com/) section of the admin dashboard. For example, if you want to set up a series and avoid major adjustments to each survey, edit at the program level. If untouched, the same survey emails, text, and questions are repeated with each cycle in the program. However, you might choose to edit a single survey, or cycle, in ways that won't affect future cycles in the program. 

>[!TIP]
> Carefully consider edits at the program level which affect all future surveys. 

### The most common single survey editing involves survey emails 

- If a survey is live, and you want to adjust the schedule or add email reminders, you need to make edits at the cycle level.  
- If you want email communications to be unique to one survey and you don’t want it to affect emails programmed for subsequent surveys, edit at the cycle level.  

For other changes needed to a live survey, read [Make changes to a live Viva Glint survey](https://www.microsoft.com/). 

>[!TIP]
> Between surveys, you can continue to edit email communications at the program level. 

## Edit a live survey schedule or add an email reminder 

A live survey is considered “locked.” To make edits to a survey schedule, editing at the individual cycle level is required.

>[!NOTE]
> The **Approved** button on that page must be toggled to **YES**.    

1. From your admin dashboard, in **Survey Programs**, navigate to the program name that you want to edit. 
2. Select the **Upcoming and Live** tab. 
3. Select the **ellipses** next to the survey you edit. 
4. Select **Manage Schedule**.

## What does an "unlinked” survey notification mean? 

Before making edits at the cycle level, a message warns that this cycle becomes unlinked. This means that changes made to the survey text, questions, or email and reminders affect only this survey. Future - linked surveys - retain inputs at the program level. 

## Relinking surveys 

If you’ve made edits at the cycle level and your survey is unlinked from the program, several unlinked reminders are tied to the cycle. 

>[!NOTE]
> - If a survey is live, it can't be re-linked. This doesn't affect the results outcomes (for example, reporting trend).
> - If the survey has ended, it doesn't need to be re-linked. 
> - Cycle-level edits aren't retained at the program level for future surveys. Edit both accordingly. 

>[!TIP]
> Make future survey changes at the program level, in between cycles. This ensures it's always clear what text, questions and communications schedule are associated with the upcoming survey.
