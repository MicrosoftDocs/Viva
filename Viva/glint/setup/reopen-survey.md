# Reopen or extend a Viva Glint survey cycle

Sometimes survey takers may need extra time to complete a survey or your response rate may not be as high as you hoped. Admins can reopen a survey cycle as long as a new cycle isn't started. The survey cycle can also be extended. 

>[!TIP]
>For best results, reopen a recently closed survey within a day or two of the survey cycle ending.

## Reopen a closed survey 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Survey close notifications aren't automatically regenerated once the original closing notification is sent. 

When a survey cycle is closed **and** the survey end notification email has sent, no further survey end notification email is sent.

Also consider:

- The Team Conversations for this survey is deleted and regenerated after the survey closes on the new date. Team Conversations isn't available while the survey is reopened.
- The **Phased Access** user role can't access the results of this survey until the role is regranted access. 
- Review and reschedule any Nudges already set. They also aren't rescheduled automatically. 

## Extend a survey cycle that hasn't closed

When a survey cycle is extended *before* its original close date, the notification generation automatically updates to reflect the new close date. The default for the survey end notification email is three days post survey cycle close.
>
> Example:
>
> - The survey end date is March 10. The survey end notification email is set to send on March 13.
> - On March 8, you extend the close date to March 15. The survey close notification automatically moves to March 18.

## Procedure for reopening or extending a survey 

1. Select the **Configuration** symbol on your admin dashboard (landing page).
2. Select **Survey Programs**.
3. In the **Survey Cycles** section, toggle to the **Completed** tab.
4. From the horizontal ellipses in the program bar, select **Reopen Survey**.
5. A **Reopen Survey Cycle** window opens.

To reopen this survey cycle, select a new close date. To avoid duplicating work for managers, reopen the cycle within one day of the previous cycle end date. Consider this guidance, then review and adjust as needed:

- **Team Conversations:** The Team Conversations for this survey are deleted and regenerated after the survey closes on the new end date. Any actions previously taken with this Team Conversations are lost and need to be restarted.
- **Nudges:** The Nudges schedule doesn't automatically update.
- **Reporting level access:** User Roles with Phased access - who were granted Live access before the survey cycle was reopened - automatically return to Phased access.
- **Alerts report:** Existing alerts are removed and regenerated after the new survey close date. No action required.
- **Survey emails:** Upcoming communications are automatically rescheduled based on the survey close date.
  
6. Select a new **Close date** for your survey.

> [!NOTE]
> A survey extension can't close *past the start date of the next scheduled survey.* If you choose an invalid date, you see a message directing you to choose a different date.

7. Select **Save.** The survey is immediately reopened and closes at midnight (11:59PM) on the selected date in the client's time zone. The survey status is now **Live**.
