# Customize Suggested Action templates in Viva Glint    

Suggested Action templates contain content that Microsoft Viva Glint includes as suggested resources to help managers achieve team-approved Focus Areas. Resources used in Action Plan templates must first exist in Content Resources.

## Viva People Science explains Focus Areas and Suggested Action templates

Focused and streamlined action planning is essential. A Suggested Action plan is a written commitment to make incremental improvements to the employee experience. It's designed to increase work engagement on your team and within your company.

## Understand terminology associated with Content Resources and Action Plans

This terminology assists with understanding how Glint sets up Suggestion Action templates: 

|Term|Definition|
|---------|---------|
|**Driver**|A factor that affects employee engagement, such as growth or culture. Survey items are developed to surface key - also referred to as "core" - drivers|
|**Suggested Action Templates**|The overall template associated with a survey item. Choosing a Focus Area from survey results directs managers to the Suggested Action Template associated with the chosen key driver|
|**Suggested Action Items**|The components of a Suggested Action Template| 
|**Content Resources**|Articles, images, PDFs, and videos that are available to managers in a Suggested Action Template|
|**Standard content**|Content that is prepopulated into Glint Content Resources. Content must first exist or be added in *Content Resources* before it is attached to a Suggested Action template.|
|**Custom content**|Content that you, as the Viva Glint customer, have uploaded to your Content Resources|

## Familiarize yourself with the Content Resources feature
