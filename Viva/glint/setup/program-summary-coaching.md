# Set up Coaching page in Program Summary

The final setup page in Program Summary is the Coaching page. On this page, admins can provide access to coaching assistance for their managers for Team Summary and Team Conversations.

Admins who have not enabled Team Conversations for their managers have only one section to set up:
- **Manager Coaching Content**

Admins who have enabled Team Conversations have two additional sections to set up:
- **Team Conversation Presentation Guidance**
- **Team Conversation Resource Guidance**
