# Set up Coaching page in Program Summary

The final setup page in Program Summary is the Coaching page. Managers can see coaching assistance admins provision for them on this page on their Team Summary dashboard.  

Admins who enabled Team Conversations for a survey have two additional sections to set up on this page. 

## Coaching set up for managers not using Team Conversations 

Coaching content provides best practices for your managers to have meaningful conversations with their teams about the future. Within Manager Coaching Content, provision these sections: 

- Interpretation: Customize the Interpretation Guide 
- Top Strengths: Customize the coaching content for Top Strengths 
- Top Opportunities: Customize the coaching content for Top Opportunities 

## Coaching set up for managers using Team Conversations

Two additional coaching sections need to be set up for managers with Team Conversations enabled. 

- Team Conversations presentation guidance 
- Team Conversations resource guidance  

Refer to [Team Conversations Coaching Page](https://www.microsoft.com) for setup of these two sections.
