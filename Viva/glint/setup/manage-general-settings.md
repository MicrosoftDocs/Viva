# Manage General Settings in Viva Glint 

Details defining your Microsoft Viva Glint programs are set up and viewed by selecting the **Configuration** symbol on your Viva Glint admin dashboard and then **General Settings** in the *Service Configuration* section. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/general-settings-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to access General Settings from the admin dashboard.":::

Use the definitions and prompts on the platform so you feel confident about the choices you make. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Any initial actions or subsequent changes in General Settings apply to all survey programs created in Viva Glint.

These sections require setup: 

## Company Information 

This section provides high-level information about your company. 
Also, set up what your employees see when they open an email sharing information about a Glint program.  

| Field | Definition and notes |
|-----------|-----------|
|**Client UUID**   | How Viva Glint identifies your company in our system.  |  
|**Client Name**    | *Or Doing Business As (DBA) name*.   | 
|**Client Time Zone**    | Survey and reminder emails are sent out in this time zone unless **Send surveys in users’ time zones** is checked. [More information on customer time zones.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2255796)   | 
|**Top-Level Manager (Chief Executive Officer - CEO)**    | This employee is used to build managerial hierarchy and is the only person in your organization that doesn't report to anyone at a higher level.| 
|**Company Privacy Policy** | To replace the Microsoft Privacy Statement, add a link to your organization’s privacy policy. The privacy policy is displayed at the beginning of Glint surveys and in the Glint navigation bar.|
|**Company Message to Survey Participants**|Enter guidance specific to your organization to be displayed at the beginning of Glint surveys and applied to new programs and scheduled surveys. Character limit: 1024|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid potential conflicts between your organization's message and Viva Glint's privacy statements. The application of one of the three privacy statements to the survey is dependent upon its configuration. [**Learn more**](/../../viva/glint/setup/viva-glint-survey-privacy). The company message displayed alongside standard privacy statements should refrain from stating anything that conflicts with the privacy statement applied to the survey.  Microsoft reserves the right to delete company messages if such conflicts comes to our attention.

>[!TIP]
>Best practice is to either link to your organization's privacy policy or to customize a message. Using both your company's privacy policy and a customized message may incur conflicts.
