# Set up Distribution in Program Summary

Distribution is the second area to set up within Program Summary. Distribution follows Program Setup; Program Setup should show a checkmark on the Program Summary section. On the Distribution page, you'll choose which of your organization's populations receive this program's survey by using existing Distribution Lists or creating new ones.

To view a spreadsheet of people already populated to receive this program, select **Download Recipients**. 

The **Exporting Member Data** window opens. This export includes all individuals - first name, last name, email address, and status- targeted by this survey. Recent edits to this programâ€™s distribution may take a few minutes to update before reflected in the export. Choose whether to include all user roles. Select **Export**.

### Follow this process to commit Distribution Lists to your program

1. Select the search panel to open a dropdown menu of Distribution Lists already available for your programs.
1. Select one or more Distribution Lists.
1. The right facing arrow will highlight; select that to **Save and Continue**
