# Add and edit 360 cycle questions 

Add or modify prepopulated 360 program template questions. Add questions from our Question Library by selecting the **+** symbol. 
- You can use the **+** symbol under the question list.
- You can also use the **+ in the blue circle** at the bottom of the page. This route takes you directly to rating and open-ended questions.

## Add a Glint validated question

**Search** for a question using a keyword or two. Hover over the question and select **+**. If everything appears as you’d like, select **Add Question**.

### View question details

If you aren’t ready to add the question because you need more information, select the **cogwheel** symbol next to the question to view:
- The question name
- The question text
- The question format
- How the question is rated (valued)
- Whether the question is optional 
- Available languages

From this section, to add the question, select **Add Question**.

Within the question details, choose whether the item is:
- Optional or mandatory - optional items are recommended so that feedback providers can skip where needed.
- The same for Subjects and Feedback providers within the cycle.
- Can be prepopulated based on employee data

>[!NOTE]
>While there isn’t a minimum or maximum number of questions for a 360 cycle, keep in mind:
> - To encourage quality feedback, a maximum of 10-20 questions - including 2-3 open-ended questions - is best.
> -	Glint recommends a minimum of six rated questions mapped to competencies.
> - A 360 report shows top strengths and opportunities based on the **All but Self** score of questions in competencies.

## Edit a Glint validated question

Select the **verticle ellipses** to open the dropdown menu and then select **Edit Question**.

Edit the question and then select **Save Changes.**
