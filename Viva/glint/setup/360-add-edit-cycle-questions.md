## Add a Glint validated question

**Search** for a question using a keyword or two. **Hover over the question and select +**. If everything appears as you’d like, select **Add Question**.

### View question details

If you aren’t ready to add the question because you need more information, select the **cogwheel symbol** next to the question to see:
- The question name
- The question text
- The question format
- How the question is rated (valued)
- Whether the question is optional 
- Available languages

From this section, to add the question, select **Add Question**.

Also within the question details, choose whether questions are
- Optional or mandatory - optional questions are recommended so that feedback providers can skip where needed.
- The same for subjects and feedback providers within the cycle.
- Can be prepopulated based on employee data

>[!NOTE]
>While there isn’t a minimum or maximum number of questions for a 360 cycle, keep in mind:
> - To encourage quality feedback, a maximum of 10-20 questions - including 2-3 open-ended questions - is best.
> -	Glint recommends a minimum of six rated questions mapped to competencies.
> - A 360 report shows top strengths and opportunities based on the *All but Self* score of questions in competencies.

## Edit a Glint validated question

Prepopulated or questions added to the cycle can be edited. Select the **verticle ellipses** to open the dropdown menu and then select **Edit Question**.

>[!TIP]
> Edit questions only when absolutely necessary, as editing may impact language translations and change the intention of the question.

Edit the question and then select **Save Changes.**
