# Add new survey items, sections, and section breaks to a Viva Glint program

 ## Add a new question to your survey

 There are three (3) types of questions which can be added to a survey:
 - Rating
 - Multiple Choice
 - Open-ended

**Setup for all three types of questions is the same.*** After the **+** symbol has been selected and you've selected the type of question to add, a slider window opens.

In the **Question Library** slider window, there is the option to select a survey item from the Viva Glint Question Library or to create your own survey item.

### Add a question from the Glint Question Library

The Viva Glint Question Library has over 400 validated items for you to choose from.

1. Use the **Sources** dropdown menu to filter the question selection to **Custom** or **Viva Glint** questions.
1. Use the **Type** dropdown menu to filter for Rating, Multiple Choice, or Open-ended questions.
1. Use the **More Filters** button to open a More Filters window. Within this window, select from these options:
   1. **External Benchmark Availability** - Filter by questions that have benchmarks associated with them.
   1. **Programs** - Filter by items used in your other programs. The search bar will display the programs by name.
   1. **Translations Available** - Filter by questions that have translations included.
   1. Select **Show Questions** to reveal your newly filtered list.

1. Select your new item from the new list and then press the **+** symbol. You will see a small "Question Added" banner display on the **Questions** page.

### Create a new question

Select the **+ Create** button. A **Create Question** window opens.

>[!CAUTION]
>Your organization may have policies governing appropriate survey questions for employees. Ensure you have consulted any such policies before proceeding. Rather than create a new item, search the Question Library for existing questions that could be reused or repurposed. Viva Glint standard questions are validated and usually come with benchmarks and action plans. 

For your new item, complete the following fields:
1. Select a **Language** from languages prepopulated in the dropdown menu
1. Select the **Question Type** - rating, multiple choice, open-ended
1. Assign a **Reporting Label** for easy identification of your item
1. Insert your **Question Text**  The **+ button** allows you to edit the question. 
1. Consider providing **Instruction Text** - Use this space to provide survey takers with helpful information about how to answer this item
1. Consider providing **Comment Placeholder Text** - "Leave your comments here" appears by default, but this text can be customized
1. Choose the **Rating Scale** for the item - 5 or 7 points
1. Decide whether to include the rating **Label for all options** - The **Low Value** (1-strongly disagree) and **High Value** (5- strongly agree) appear by default. If you would like to define values 2,3, and 4, toggle to Yes and then assign their meaning. For example: 2 = disagree
1. Decide whether to **Allow Comments** - Toggle to Yes or No
1. Decide whether this item can be an **Optional Question** - Toggle to Yes or No
1. Choose a **Suggested Action Template** - Use the dropdown menu to attach this survey item to a previously configured Suggested Action Template to help you manager act on feedback
1. Select **Save and Add**.

## Differentiate between a *section break* and a *survey section*

>[!TIP]
> - Section break: User scrolls and new items continue to be shown without any header. For surveys that intend to cover more than one topic, give survey takers notice that the topic is switching (for example, from Engagement to Benefits) and add a Section Break.
> - Survey section: A persistent header with multiple items tied to it, which remains at the top of the screen as the user responds.
