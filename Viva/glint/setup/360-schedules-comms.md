# Setup schedules and communications for a Viva Glint 360 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-schedule-comms-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot how to access Schedule and Communications setup in Cycle Settings.":::

## Schedule setup 

There are five sections to set up:
- Schedule
- Admin Communication
- 360 Communications Triggers and Notifications
- Reminder Timing
- Notification History

### Schedule

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-schedule-comms.png" lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/360-schedule-comms.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Schedule setup.":::

Set up key cycle dates. A 3-5 week schedule is recommended.

- **Cycle Start Date**: When subjects are invited
- **Feedback Provider Selection End Date**: 1-2 weeks from the Cycle Start Date; intended as a soft deadline for the subject to add feedback providers
- **Cycle Close Date**: 2-3 weeks after the Feedback Provider Selection End Date

### Admin Communication setup

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-admin-comms.png" lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/360-admin-comms.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Admin Communication setup.":::

Designate which Glint company admin manages subject questions. Only one admin can have this permission. In this section, also designate which admins receive notifications for this cycle.

- **Admin contact for cycle**: The admin’s name and email address, which is included in various emails and on the 360 overview page. They are the point of contact for the 360 subject.
- **Admin notifications to**: Select which admins receive email notifications. They also receive low response rate and opt-out emails.

### 360 Triggers & Notifications setup

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-comms-triggers.png" lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/360-comms-triggers.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Triggers and Notifications setup.":::

Edit communication content, add reminders, and set communication timings in this section. 

To edit and preview communication content, hover over the communication and select the **pencil symbol.** To delete a communication, for example, if you do not use coaches, remove the reference to coaches.

### Reminder Timing

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-reminder-timing.png" lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/360-reminder-timing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Reminder Timing setup.":::

Choose the time window for email reminders to be sent. A two-hour window is recommended. If the time zone needs to be changed, access **General Settings** on your admin configuration dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Confirm that domains from Glint’s Allowed List are approved so that 360 emails are delivered.

>[!NOTE]
> Reminders can be added during a live 360 cycle but only apply to emails which haven’t sent. 

### Notifications History

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/360-notifications-history.png" lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/360-notifications-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Notifications History viewing.":::

When a cycle is live, the notification history for subjects, feedback providers and report recipients is shown. 


## Complete communications setup
Select **Save Changes**. Communications aren't editable until the schedule and admin contact are saved. The program displays red boxes around required fields that are incomplete.
