# 360 User Roles and permissions

By default, people in the Viva Glint admin role have access to create and edit all Glint programs, including 360s. You may, however, choose to set up an extra user role to *only* have access to edit 360 programs. In this case, you first need to create a user role - or adjust an existing user role - to have exclusive 360 admin permissions. 

More information on [Create a Viva Glint User Role](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230740).

## Create a unique 360 User Role

From the Glint admin dashboard, select the **Configuration symbol** and then **User Roles.** 

1.	If you created a user role specifically for 360 feedback program administration, select this role. If you’re adding a new 360 feedback admin role, select **+ New Role.**
1.	In the *Untitled Role* page that opens, name your User Role by selecting the **pencil symbol**. Choose an name easily identifiable cycle name.
1.	Select **Permissions** and scroll down to the *Feedback* section of the page.

4.  Enable **Access 360 feedback**.
5.	Select **Manage Feedback** to allow anyone in this role to edit 360 programs.  
6.	Select **Save Changes** and then **Save Permissions**.

1.	Now, in *All Members*, add all subjects and people who will be granted access to a subject’s 360 report to that user role. Use the search bar to search employee names.

## Accesss to feedback

Subjects and leaders involved in 360s need access to the Feedback tab on their Glint dashboard. 

It’s optional to grant feedback providers access to the Feedback tab. Granting access enables them to log in and view any open or historical requests to provide feedback to a 360 subject.

### Feedback tab features

Subject use of the feedback tab includes:

- Seeing all active feedback requests 
- Adding or editing feedback providers 
- Completing their self-assessment 
- View who responded to their 360 cycle, if the admin provided this permission

Subjects can all see all completed feedback history.

## Allow 360 subjects to create Focus Areas

Following the procedure for granting feedback access, enable Create Focus Areas permission for subjects to allow them to create a Focus Area from their 360 report. This permission enables the Focus Areas tab on their Glint dashboard.

>[!NOTE]
>Your organization may opt to substitute the word Goals for Focus Areas. There are many opportunities to customize the program to use terminology which is comfortable in your business. *For this reason, written guidance and images may not always appear verbatim.*

## Add and edit employees after the initial role creation

Use the **Add/Edit Employees** button to open the *Choose a way to add employees* window. Follow the on-screen guidance.

> [!TIP]
> Within a user’s profile, use the View As feature to confirm a user’s access to a program.
