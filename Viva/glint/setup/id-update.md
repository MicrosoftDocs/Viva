# Update employee IDs in Viva Glint

Use the Microsoft Viva Glint employee ID update feature to keep employee information current. Viva Glint admins can update users' IDs when there are:

- Duplicated IDs
- Missed leading zeros
- Acquisitions
- Rehires
- Changes in HR information system (HRIS) vendor
- Incorrect IDs

## How to update a user's employee ID

To update a user's ID as a Viva Glint admin:

1. From the admin dashboard, select the **Configuration** symbol and in the **Employees** section, choose **People**.
1. Search for and select a user to go to their Glint profile.
1. At the top of the page, select the pencil symbol next to **Employee ID**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Employee IDs must be unique for each user. If you update an ID to a value that's already in use by another user, you see this message: 
> "**Update didn't save.** This Employee ID is already in use by user@contoso.com"
