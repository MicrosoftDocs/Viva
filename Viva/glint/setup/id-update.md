# Update employee IDs in Viva Glint

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is targeted to be available after July 27, 2024.

Use the Microsoft Viva Glint employee ID update feature to keep employee information current. Viva Glint admins can update users' IDs when there are:

- Duplicated IDs
- Missed leading zeros
- Acquisitions
- Rehires
- Changes in HR information system (HRIS) vendor
- Incorrect IDs

## How to update a user's employee ID

To update a user's ID as a Viva Glint admin:

1. From the admin dashboard, select the **Configuration** symbol and in the **Employees** section, choose **People**.
1. Search for and select a user to go to their Glint profile.
1. At the top of the page, select the pencil symbol next to **Employee ID**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Employee IDs must be unique for each user. If you update an ID to a value that's already in use by another user, you see this message: 
> "**Update didn't save.** This Employee ID is already in use by user@contoso.com"
