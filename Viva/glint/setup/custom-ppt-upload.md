# Customize a PowerPoint template in Viva Glint

To communicate more engagingly with stakeholders, admins can use customized PowerPoint (PPT) templates. One of the most important aspects to drive response rate and engagement is to make survey takers feel that the survey product and reporting come from a reliable source and that their privacy is protected. **Personal branding increases response rates as it provides feelings of reliability and privacy.**

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Permission settings in PowerPoint files affect how Viva Glint accesses custom templates. Ensure your template is not locked or restricted from editing. Otherwise, the exporting process may fail.

## Create a customized template folder

Customized templates are stored in folders that you create. You can create as many folders as you’d like and save them to use as appropriate.

1.	From the **General Settings** feature on your admin dashboard, navigate to **Reporting** and then **PowerPoint Templates for Reports**.

2.	Select **Modify templates**.
3.	Select **+ New template folder** to open the **Create a new template folder** window.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/general-settings-create-template-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot of New template folder button.":::

4.	Enter a descriptive name for your folder.
5.	Select a survey type from the dropdown menu. You can choose “All” as one of the choices.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/general-settings-name-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot of fields requiring set up to create a new template folder.":::

6.	Select **Create**. Your new folder now appears as its own row on the **PowerPoint Templates for Reports** page.

## Customize a template

Edits for custom templates occur offline.

The first time you open a folder, you see that no customized versions of the template exist.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/template-no-customized.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an alert telling you that no customized versions of your template are uploaded.":::

1.	Select **Download template**.
2.	From the window that opens, select as many languages as needed from the prepopulated language dropdown menu.
3.	Select **Download**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/template-ppt-download-sample.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Download a default template as a sample dialog box.":::

4.	Open the downloaded export in a new tab.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-ppt-new-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to download the new template and open it in a new tab.":::

5.	**Customize the presentation-manually** using your organization's logo, familiar terminology, and important, relevant text content. Save the presentation with a new and easily identifiable name. In this example, the survey is named *Spring Engagement Survey 2024*.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/ppt-customized.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a customized PowerPoint template.":::

## Upload your customized PowerPoint presentation

1.	From the **PowerPoint Templates for Reports** window, choose the folder for your customized template to be added to. In this example, *Spring Engagement* is opened.
2.	Select **Upload a PowerPoint file** to open the **Upload a PowerPoint file** dialog box.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-ppt-new-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the how to download the new template and open in a new tab.":::

3.	Browse your files to drag and drop the custom template into the upload box.
4.	Select a language to upload and then select **Upload file**. Upload as many languages into the folder as needed.
5.	Now when opening the folder, custom templates are available. From the folder name, you can see the number of languages the template exists in and the number of surveys the custom template is linked to. Within the folder, you can access each individual template.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-ppt-folder-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the PowerPoint Template for Reports, verifying the folder contents.":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-ppt-languages.png" alt-text="Screenshot of which languages of the template that exist within the folder.":::

### Edit the presentation template

To edit, open, or delete a folder, use the ellipses next to the template name.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-ppt-ellipses.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the template folder dropdown menu.":::
 
### Edit folder name and type

Modify as needed and select **Update**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-update-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Update template folder dialog box.":::

### Open template folder

Use to see all the customized templates in that folder.

### Delete a template folder

If you attempt to delete a folder that is associated with a survey report, this window appears:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-ppt-cannot-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog box alerting that the folder can't be deleted.":::

If a file isn't associated with a survey report, this confirmation box appears before you can delete the template. This process isn't reversible.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/custom-ppt-delete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dialog box which allows template deletion.":::

## Use your customized PowerPoint with any Glint program

Now that you created a folder and a customized template, your customized presentation can be used for any Glint feedback presentation.

1.	From your admin dashboard, navigate to **Survey Programs** and choose a survey. 
2.	In **Program Summary**, go to the **Reporting** tab. All presentation folders available for your Glint programs show in the **PowerPoint Export Template** dropdown menu.
The Glint Default Template is always available.
