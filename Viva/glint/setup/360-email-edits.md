# Customize Viva Glint 360 email content (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

## Custom sending domains and branding (optional)

In the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2264234), your Microsoft 365 admin can optionally configure a custom sending domain for your organization. In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/#home), customize your organization's branding to include your logo in 360 survey communications:

- [Set up a custom sending domain](/microsoft-365/admin/email/select-domain-to-use-for-email-from-microsoft-365-products)
- [Customize company branding](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/customize-sign-in-page)

Both items are **optional steps** that your organization can take to further customize the 360 communication experience for your survey participants.

> [!NOTE]
> - Custom sending domains configured in MAC can impact other M365 products. See [Set up a custom sending domain](/microsoft-365/admin/email/select-domain-to-use-for-email-from-microsoft-365-products) for a full list.
> - Viva Glint teams have access to limited email delivery metrics. Using a custom sender domain gives your organization direct access to your email delivery data.

### Email macros

Macros in Viva Glint 360 emails allow your organization to add Viva Glint placeholders that pull in information based on users' names in your employee data. For example, include Subject Due Date, Days to Complete Feedback, or Feedback Cycle Name in email text to further customize for 360 survey participants. To add a macro, select the plus sign icon in email sections where it exists and choose a macro from the dropdown menu.

### Use the language dropdown

In the 360 email edit pane, after customizing English content, use the **Language** dropdown menu to select other survey languages and add translations to each survey section. Select **Save Changes** in the top right to save all of your edits.
