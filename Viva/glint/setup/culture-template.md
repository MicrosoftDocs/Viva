# Use the Viva Glint Culture Survey template

Recognizing that most executives and leaders realize the importance and impact of culture on business outcomes, Glint offers a Culture Survey template as part of its library of recurring engagement surveys. The Glint Culture Survey measures the facets of culture Viva People Science knows to be important predictors of business performance and engagement. The Culture Survey is available in all languages supported by Glint.

## How Viva Glint defines culture and why culture is important

Glint research backs the fact that culture is driven by mindsets, values and shared beliefs. These components influence how decisions get made, how people behave, shape our experiences, and determine how work gets done.

## How does Viva Glint measure culture?

Glint focuses on measuring observable group behaviors that impact important performance outcomes. This approach is the most valid way of measuring organizational culture. It's important to measure culture by asking about the group, rather than about an individual. Culture is a group phenomenon which is created and reinforced through the interactions of many. By rating various group behaviors, rather than asking individuals what they think or how they feel, the survey items are also more actionable.

## Key outcomes and goals of a culture survey program

A cultural measure is intended to help leaders check on the alignment of their intended culture against the actual culture experienced by employees. The survey informs priorities and actions that require attention at the organizational level. The Viva Glint Culture Survey answers whether your company has the culture needed to be successful in the future. 

## What kind of organization is the Culture Survey intended for?

This program is for organizations interested in gaining a baseline understanding of their current culture to support transformation.

## Should our Culture Survey be combined with other Glint survey programs?

​​​Combining culture and engagement surveys isn't recommended. Length and competing core drivers are often hard for participants to manage. There is, however, an opportunity to measure culture in every stage of the employee lifecycle, from recruiting to exit.

Within the Culture Survey, other outcomes can be determined if you choose to add more questions, such as:
- Current culture
- Safety
- Innovation
- Trust
- Inclusiveness

## Best Practice recommendations for cultural transformation

- **Define, state, and role model your organization’s collective culture and values.**
- **Align your desired culture with all aspects of the employee experience.** Reinforce culture across the employee lifecycle, including hiring, onboarding, development, performance practices, engagement, and exit. Connect the cultural insights.
- **Ask employees about their cultural experience regularly.** Asking employees about their cultural experience annually to be sure that the desired culture is the one that employees are experiencing.
- **Build trust by ensuring cultural consistency and alignment.** People learn by observation and repetition. A strong culture is one that is predictable.
