# Program setup in Program Summary

The Program Setup page is the first configuration page within Program Summary. It allows you to define the basics of your program.

## Procedure for setting up the Program Setup page 

1. Enter a **Program Name**.
1. Select the administrators by searching by **Role** or entering their name into the **Search** feature.
1. Select the **Default Language** from the dropdown menu.
1. The list of **Additional Languages** is open and prepopulated with languages that have been set up for your organization in **General Settings**. To remove languages, select the **X** next to the language name.
1. **Admin Notifications** are prepopulated too. Use the **Search** field to add other admins. To remove an admin, select *X* next to their name.
1. Use the **Suggested Action Available** toggle to disable or enable users to create goals.
1. Use the **Eligible for Nudges** toggle to disable or enable timely messages to managers. Refer to the [Nudges lesson for additional setup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231015).  
1. Confidential Responses are set to YES by default.  
1. **Allow Pulse Resubmission** is enabled by default. **NO** disables the feature and a user who wants to retake their survey must request a manual reset.
1. **Enable Team Conversations** is enabled by default. **NO** disables the feature for the program. For more information, see Team Conversations. 
1. When Team Conversations is enabled, **Enable Team Conversations Sharing** is enabled by default. **NO** disables managers from sharing this read-only version of Team Conversations.
