# Set up a Microsoft Viva Glint Patient Safety survey 

Many healthcare customers use the Viva Glint Patient Safety Survey to assess and improve their patient safety culture. It is approved as a reliable measure of patient culture by Leapfrog's expert panel and is among the most succinct Leapfrog-approved safety surveys currently available. Seamlessly integrated with Viva Glint, patient safety survey insights are designed to get to healthcare leaders in real-time. 

## Submitting the Patient Safety Survey for Leapfrog certification

To submit the survey to Leapfrog for certification, it must include the 16 Leapfrog approved items in this *exact* order:
1. Modeling
1. Communication
1. Root Cause
1. Learn From Mistakes
1. Change Willingness
1. Just Response
1. Exchange
1. Resources
1. Training
1. Teamwork
1. Ownership
1. Voice
1. Psychological Safety
1. Recognition
1. Safety Habits
1. Safety Referral

There are also two optional but recommended scaled items (1-2), and two comment items (3-4) which can be included:
1. Employee Safety
1. eSat
1. Safety - Start Doing
1. Safety - Stop Doing

> [!NOTE]
> The overall patient safety outcome items, Referral and Habits, are now at the end of the survey; previously they were the first items asked.
