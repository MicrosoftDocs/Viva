# Access Viva Glint with Microsoft Entra ID

To access the Microsoft Viva Glint application, a Global administrator must register Viva Glint in a Microsoft Entra tenant. A service administrator must also import users to Viva Glint. Users must exist in both Microsoft Entra ID and Viva Glint with the same email address to successfully access the application.

If you don't already have a Microsoft Entra user account, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

>[!NOTE]
> To add a Support or Partner user to Viva Glint, follow this guidance: [Add an external user to Viva Glint.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2240483)

## Import users to Viva Glint

The Global administrator adds service administrators to Microsoft Entra ID and Viva Glint for initial access. As the service administrator, see information below to add other users (HR, leadership, managers, individual contributors) to Viva Glint.

> [!NOTE]
> Email addresses for users in Viva Glint must match email addresses tied to users in Microsoft Entra ID. Coordinate with the Global administrator for your Viva Glint Microsoft Entra tenant to ensure that these email addresses match.
