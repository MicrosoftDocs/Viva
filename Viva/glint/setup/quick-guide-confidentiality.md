# Manager Quick Guide - Confidentiality
Suppression thresholds add a layer of protection to your peoples' privacy. In some cases, even when the **response threshold** is met, the ability to filter results by responder attributes and might allow a responder's identify to be inferred by comparing results. 

In these cases, responses are "suppressed" — not reported even if the minimum response threshold was met. The *suppression threshold* requires more than two responses that separate the smallest attribute group from the smallest group that meets the minimum response threshold.

## Understand insufficient and sufficient data suppression
**Viva Glint protects the confidentiality of individual survey responses** 

- Viva Glint doesn't show individual responses for confidential surveys. Within reports, scores are only shown in combined totals. 
- Viva Glint needs to connect scores to individuals to analyze data by different populations, but this data can only be seen in a restricted raw data file. Data is private and only admins can view it. 
- Viva Glint doesn't show scores for teams or groups that fall below the confidentiality threshold and limits the use of filters that could inadvertently reveal confidential information. 

**Viva Glint’s sets standard confidentiality thresholds** 
- Five respondents per reporting group to display scores 
- 10 respondents per reporting group (not 10 comments) to display open- ended comments (if a manager’s team had 10 responses but only one comment, that comment shows) 

**The difference between insufficient data and suppressed data** 
- A manager sees an insufficient data message if the number of respondents or total group size doesn’t meet the minimum threshold set. 
- To prevent guessing the scores of respondent groups with insufficient data using simple math, the next smallest group is also suppressed.  

Let’s check out an example... 

Michelle’s team has five (5) or more respondents, but their score isn't displayed. Why?

| Group | All | Amy's team | Mike's team | Michelle's team | Dave's team |
|:-------:|:-----:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
|**Respondents**|23|10|7|5|1|
|**Score**|73|76|76|~~76~~|?|
|**Display Status**|Displayed|Displayed|Displayed|Suppressed|Insufficient|

The chart tells us that:
- Dave’s team, with only one (1) respondent, is insufficient. It doesn't meet the minimum confidentiality threshold of five (5) required respondents, therefore, the score from Dave’s team isn't displayed. 
- Michelle’s team has the next smallest number of respondents, and her team met the minimum threshold of five (5) required respondents. However, by displaying Michelle’s team’s score, it may become possible to deduce Dave’s team score using simple math. With calculation, the one respondent on Dave’s team can be discovered, breaching that individual respondent’s confidentiality. In turn, Michelle’s team scores are suppressed and not visible. 
- If Dave’s team had two (2) respondents it would be difficult to calculate both individual scores, so Michelle’s team’s score would be displayed. 
> [!NOTE]
> Dave’s team score, even with two (2) respondents, won't be shown because it still doesn't meet the confidentiality threshold. 

## What to do with small team results

Managers of small teams can feel that survey results don’t provide as much value, especially if they regularly connect with their team. But when teams don’t have enough responses to view their results, [Broader Team Insights (BTI)](/viva/glint/reports/broader-team-insights) is helpful in giving a sense for how the larger org is doing.

Managers can have an [ACT Conversation](/viva/glint/reports/take-action-team-conversations) with their team using roll-up (BTI) results. Throughout the Acknowledge part of an ACT conversation, the manager should talk to the team about which results might be pertinent to their smaller team.

If BTI isn't enabled for managers, leaders of small teams can still hold ACT Conversation. Managers can discuss where the larger organization's results do and don't reflect their smaller group experience and what action the team can commit to make improvements.
