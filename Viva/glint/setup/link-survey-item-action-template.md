# Linking a new survey item to an action template in Viva Glint

Most standard survey items are automatically linked to a Suggested Action template by default. You can edit an existing template and link new items to it. *This action creates a new template (clone), which needs to be renamed.*

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action Templates**. 
1. Choose the template to add an item to from the **Name** column. You see the item linked to the template. An item may appear twice if the item scale was different between surveys. Hover over the item to see where the item was used and the point scale assigned to it. 
1. Select the **pencil** symbol to edit. 
1. Use the dropdown menu to **find the new question**. Type in the key driver or a few words from the item to search and find it.
1. Select **Update**. The new item now shows in the *Questions* section.
1. Select **Save**. The *Create new Suggested Action Template* name box opens. *This step prevents the original template from being altered.*
1. Insert a name that resonates with you, for ease of finding it later. 
1. Select **Done**. *Your new Suggested Action Template now appears as a Custom template*.

   > [!NOTE]
   >Suggested Action Templates update in real time. Often standard survey items are shared across multiple survey programs. You may be updating a template currently in use. Be sure the addition is useful to anyone choosing this template. 

## Editing a suggested action item 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action**.  
1. Select the template from the **Name** column. 
1. On the template page, under *Suggested Action Items*, tap the action to be edited and select the **pencil** symbol. 
1. On the *Resource* page, edit the title, add to, or edit the description, add, or edit video link. 

## Moving a Suggested Action item 

1. Tap the action item to be reordered. 
1. Use the three horizontal lines to drag and place the item elsewhere in the list.  

## Deleting a Suggested Action item
  
1. Tap the action item to be deleted. 
1. Select the **trash can** symbol.

## Adding default action items to a Suggested Action Template 

Default Action Items automatically appear anytime a new Focus Area is created for that item. For any Suggested Action Item that your company wants users to review, tap on the item and select **Move to Default**.

## Deleting Custom Content Resources

Custom content is identified within the column labeled *Shared* in *Content Resources* on the admin dashboard.

To delete custom content, it can't be associated with any Action Plan or any other resources. 
Select the **trash can** symbol next to the custom resource. If any dependencies exist, the name of the dependency displays:

Select **Got It!** to remove the custom content from the associated resource. Select the **trash can** symbol. 

When there are no dependencies, the *Are you sure?* dialog box displays. Select your appropriate answer.
