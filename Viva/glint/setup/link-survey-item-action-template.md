# Link an item to a Suggested Action template in Viva Glint

Standard resources are most often automatically linked to a Suggested Action template by default. You can edit an existing template and link new items to it. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>A new Action template, created by cloning an existing template, needs to be renamed.

## Map a new question to a Suggested Action template

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action Templates**. 
1. Select the template to add an item to from the *Name* column. The survey item (question) is linked to the template.
   >[!NOTE]
   >An item may appear twice if the item scale was different between surveys. Hover over the item to see where the item was used and the point scale assigned to it. 
1. Select the **pencil** symbol to reveal the dropdown menu to find your new question for mapping.

1. Type in the key driver or a few words from the item to search and find it.
1. Select **Update**.

1. The *Create new Suggested Action Template name* window opens. **This step prevents the original template from being altered.**

1. Choose a name that resonates with you, for ease of finding it later. Select **Done**. *Your new Suggested Action Template now appears as a Custom template*.

   > [!NOTE]
   >Suggested Action templates update in real time. Often standard survey items are shared across multiple survey programs. Ensure the update is useful for anyone who might currently be using the Suggested Action Plan template.

## Edit a Suggested Action item 

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action**.  
1. Select the template from the **Name** column. 
1. On the template page, under *Suggested Action Items*, tap the action to be edited and select the **pencil** symbol. 
1. On the *Resource* page, edit the title, add to, or edit the description, add, or edit video link. 

## Move a Suggested Action item 

1. Tap the action item to be reordered. 
1. Use the three horizontal lines to drag and place the item elsewhere in the list.  

## Delete a Suggested Action item
  
1. Tap the action item to be deleted. 
1. Select the **trash can** symbol.

## Add a default action item 

Default action items automatically appear anytime a new Focus Area is created for that item. For any Suggested Action Item that your company wants users to review, select **Move to Default** next to that item.

## Delete custom Content Resources

Custom content is identified within the column labeled *Shared* in *Content Resources* on the admin dashboard.

To delete custom content, it can't be associated with any Action Plan or any other resources. 
Select the **trash can** symbol next to the custom resource. If any dependencies exist, the name of the dependency displays:

Select **Got It!** to remove the custom content from the associated resource. Select the **trash can** symbol. 

When there are no dependencies, the *Are you sure?* window displays. Select your appropriate answer.
