# Embedding Content Resources into Action Plans

LinkedIn Learning videos are selected for and attached to Viva Glint Action Plan templates. If you’re a LinkedIn Learning customer who wants to add different course content to your template, check out [LinkedIn Learning Customer Success: Course Content Corner](https://learning.linkedin.com/customer-success-center/linkedin-learning-course-content-corner?lr=1). 

## Adding a LinkedIn Learning video to Content Resources

Follow these guidelines:

1. Locate this section of the URL, which is within quotes: **https://linkedin.com/learning/embed/**
