# Convert a public SSH key to OpenSSH format for Viva Glint SFTP

To connect to your Microsoft Viva Glint Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) account, the SSH key pair that your organization (or an HRIS vendor) generates needs:

- A key length of as least 2048, ideally 4096 bits.
- To be type RSA in **OpenSSH format**.

To create a key pair for an individual user that follows these guidelines, see: [Create an SSH key pair](sftp-ssh-key-gen.md). If your organization has an HRIS vendor that connects to Viva Glint SFTP and can't generate a key pair in OpenSSH format, use these instructions to convert the SSH public key to the correct format.

An OpenSSH public key (RSA type) should look similar to this example, and always start with 'ssh-rsa':

`ssh-rsa AAAA.....1ng3pj`

> [!NOTE]
> PGP keys are designed to encrypt data files and not to access SFTP. PGP keys can't be converted to OpenSSH format. To encrypt data files with Viva Glint's PGP public key, copy your organization's PGP key from SFTP setup in General Settings. [Learn more](set-up-sftp.md).

### OpenSSH2 format

What your key file looks like:

```
---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
Comment: "rsa-key-20240201"
AAAAB..........vlsRMQ==
---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
```

To convert to OpenSSH format:

1. Save the public key as a .pub file to a location on your computer with a text editor, like Notepad. 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Don't include spaces in the file name.

3. Replace `file location` and select enter to go to the folder where your key file is saved.
4. Copy and paste this command into Command Prompt: `ssh-keygen -i -f filename.pub > new-filename.pub`
5. Replace `filename` with the name of your public key file and select **enter**.
6. Command Prompt generates a converted, OpenSSH version of the public key in a new file.
7. Open File Explorer and search for `new-filename`.pub and open the file in a text editor, like Notepad.
8. Copy and paste the full text of the key from Notepad, including `ssh-rsa`.
9. Paste the new public key text into the **SSH Public Key** field in Viva Glint **SFTP Setup**.
