# Allowlist information for Viva Glint

Microsoft Viva Glint operates in two distinct geographical regions: the United States (US) and in the European Union (EU). Add approved domains, IP addresses, and ports, which can be different depending on your account's region, to your organization's allowlist. Viva Glint recommends that you add **full domains,** and not the specific addresses. For example, to ensure users receive invites from no-reply@glint.mail.microsoft, add **glint.mail.microsoft** to your allowed list.

## Add email sender domains

Viva Glint emails come from one of the domains listed here for the US and EU. Add the following domains to your allowlist:

- glint.mail.microsoft - Survey Notifications
- microsoft.com - Microsoft Email Communications
- email1.microsoft.com - Newsletter and Product Updates

#### Glint survey and system emails for the US and EU originate from:

- **no-reply@glint.mail.microsoft**

## Logos and images

Confirm that your email service permits Viva Glint emails to display images for **logos** to render. Some third-party email applications have security restrictions in place that block the download of images into an email. To display the default Viva Glint logo, ensure that fd-glint-glintus1.azurefd.net (US) or fd-glint-glinteu1.azurefd.net (EU) are added to your allowlist and that automatic image downloads from external senders are allowed. If your organization uses [custom company branding](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding), images download automatically.

## Spam gateways

If there are any **Spam gateways** on your exchange server, ensure that they're configured to successfully receive survey emails in bulk from Viva Glint without causing throttling, delays, or bounce backs.

## Inbox filtering

Some email providers have **special inboxes that automatically filter** certain types of mail. To ensure email from Viva Glint arrives in employees' primary inbox, review your application or exchange server settings.

Your organization may require domains or URLs to be opened to access Viva Glint's application. The following hosts and ports need to be allowed, depending on which region your account resides in.
