# Set up a Viva Glint Manager Effectiveness Survey

Microsoft Viva Glint’s Manager Effectiveness Survey helps develop stronger managers through frequent team feedback and data-driven insights specific to each manager. Glint uses this data to provide managers with action plans to improve their effectiveness. These plans include learning resources and tracking tools. Manager Effectiveness surveys lay the foundation for seamless assessment, analytics, and action planning across the complete manager experience.

Manager Effectiveness surveys are designed to assess the performance and effectiveness of managers within an organization. The survey evaluates leadership skills, communication abilities, decision-making, and other managerial competencies. Valuable insights are collected by gathering feedback from employees who work under the manager’s supervision. Insights identify areas for improvement and implement strategies that enhance leadership effectiveness. Organizations should use survey results to address existing issues and drive positive change. Use cases for Manager Effectiveness Surveys include leadership development, performance improvement, and strengthening the manager-employee relationship.  

Glint’s Manager Effectiveness program provides action plans, learning resources, and tracking tools to support managers in improving their effectiveness.
