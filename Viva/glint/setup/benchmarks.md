# Viva Glint benchmark collateral  

Microsoft Viva Glint believes that global benchmarks provide level-setting comparisons during an initial survey. These benchmarks may not be as useful to the organization as internal and trend comparisons in future surveys.  

Viva Glint develops benchmarks from data gathered from over 1,300 customers, employing over 10 million people. Most of our customers use our standard survey questions, enabling us to offer global, high-performing, industry, and country benchmark suites using cross-customer data exclusively. Viva Glint’s client-based benchmarks are among the best in the industry. 

## Viva Glint standards are robust and aspirational 

We strongly urge our customers to use our standards—the overall global and high-performance benchmarks (top 10th & top 25th percentile). They're more powerful and aspirational than a custom norm (for example, industry-specific). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Viva Glint doesn't share customer names included in benchmark research.

## Viva Glint’s cadence for benchmark updates 

Benchmarks represent a comprehensive and current set of norms, which provide accurate and relevant comparisons for customers. Benchmarks are updated to reflect customer needs and emerging industry interests.  

*Global* benchmarks are updated twice a year. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is unnecessary to update benchmarks more frequently as scores rarely change more than a point or two between updates.

## Considerations for choosing a benchmark 

Consider the following items when choosing benchmarks for your managers: 

- Where does your company compete for talent? Within industry, or across industries? 
- Engagement practices vary—companies in the same industry can have different strategies for success (for example, low-cost vs. premium service models). 
- Companies aspire to be among the top 20% in specific areas that are important to them. 

  > [!TIP]
  > For large customers, use a broad benchmark like our global benchmark, not one specific to an industry. Viva Glint’s global benchmark is applicable to all parts of a business and provides a solid baseline comparison. Often talent comes from or leaves to go to organizations in a different industry, so our global benchmark may be more helpful, from a talent acquisition and retention perspective.
  > As you continue to survey, trend scores within your organization may become more informative than benchmarks.

## Considerations for updating benchmarks

Updated benchmarks provide comparisons by standard segments, such as country or industry, and by added items that may be part of a customer’s survey feedback. Comparison trends provide valuable insights unavailable in Viva Glint benchmarks. For example, newly benchmarked diversity and inclusion items can help customers interpret the effectiveness of internal programs.

> [!NOTE]
> Deploying new benchmarks will retroactively impact customer reports, action plans, etc. for past surveys. It's beneficial to adopt the latest benchmark suite available; always announce a change in benchmark with a thorough internal communications.

## Survey item edits that affect benchmark comparison

Viva Glint extensive research is used to identify the most reliable and valid items linked to survey goals. Our benchmarks are created using the exact text from these items. Even a slight change to a question or statement can alter the meaning enough to invalidate a comparison to the benchmark. 

> [!TIP]
> Ensure alignment to the standard Viva Glint item text so benchmarks are truly an apples-to-apples comparison. There may be cases where slight edits don't alter the meaning and the item still applies to the benchmark. In cases where major edits alter the item's meaning, Viva Glint doesn't recommend using a standard benchmarked item. Instead, create a copy and treat it as a custom item. While losing a benchmark might seem like a disadvantage, using items that are most relevant to your organizational needs and measuring progress over time are more impactful.

### Examples of when to edit the standard item or make a copy

1. Example 1: Matching the language of the business 

   - **Standard:** I would recommend my manager to others.
   - **Modified:** I would recommend my supervisor to others. 
   - **Recommendation:** Modifying a term in the item to make it more specific to your organizational language is acceptable. Edit the standard item without creating a copy to retain the benchmark.

1. Example 2: Using synonyms 

   - **Standard:** The recruitment process was excellent. 
   - **Modified:** The recruitment process was great.  
   - **Recommendation:** If the replacement word is likely to be interpreted similarly, the item change is acceptable. Edit the standard item without creating a copy to retain the benchmark.  

1. Example 3: Altering the subject 
   - **Standard:** I feel empowered to make decisions regarding my work. 
   - **Modified:** My manager empowers me to make decisions regarding my work.  
   - **Recommendation:** Altering the subject in an item changes the way people respond. Create a copy of the standard item and customize the copy so that there isn't an invalid benchmark tied to the edited item.

1. Example 4: Altering the meaning 
   - **Standard:** My manager provides me with feedback that helps me improve my performance. 
   - **Modified:** My manager and I have regular conversations.   
   - **Recommendation:** When the meaning of an item is fundamentally altered, the change is not recommended. Create a copy of the standard item and customize the copy so that there isn't an invalid benchmark tied to the edited item.

> Update translations with edits to English when modifying a standard or a copy of a standard Viva Glint survey item.
