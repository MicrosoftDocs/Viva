# Use Viva Glint benchmarks  

Microsoft Viva Glint believes that global benchmarks can provide useful level-setting comparisons during an initial survey, but they aren't as useful to the organization as internal and trend (historical) comparisons in subsequent surveys.  

With 10 years of experience with benchmarking, Viva Glint now serves over 900 global customers from across every industry. Most of our customers use our standard survey questions, enabling us to offer global, high-performing, industry, and country benchmark suites using cross-customer data exclusively. Viva Glint’s client-based benchmarks are among the best in the industry. 

## Viva Glint standards are robust and aspirational 

We strongly urge our customers to use our standards - the overall global and high-performance benchmarks (top 10th & top 25th percentile). They're more powerful and aspirational than a custom norm (For example, industry-specific).

- Customer-based benchmarks: Provide more value at lower cost 
- Custom benchmarks: Not worth the time, cost, and effort 
- The 2022 Global Benchmark Suite at-a-glance 
- The new benchmark generation process 
- Benchmark offerings:
   - Global benchmarks 
   - Industry benchmarks
   - Country benchmarks
   - Nursing Excellence (Magnet) benchmarks 

## Viva Glint’s cadence for benchmark updates 

Benchmarks represent a comprehensive and current set of norms that provide accurate and relevant comparisons for customers. Benchmarks are updated annually to reflect customer needs and emerging industry interests.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >It is unnecessary to update benchmarks more frequently as scores rarely change more than a point or two between updates.

## Considerations for choosing a benchmark 

Think about the following when choosing the list of benchmarks for your managers to use: 

- Where does your company compete for talent? Within industry, or across industries? 
- Engagement practices vary - companies in the same industry can have different strategies for success (for example, low-cost vs. premium service models). 
- Companies aspire to be among the top 20% in specific areas that are important to them. 

  > [!TIP]
  >For large customers, we initially advise using a broad benchmark like our global benchmark, not one specific to an industry. Glint’s global benchmark is applicable to all parts of a business and provides a solid baseline comparison. Often talent comes from or leaves to go to organizations in a different industry, so our global benchmark may be more helpful from a talent acquisition and retention perspective. Then, as customers continue to survey, comparisons of scores change over time (trend) and how groups compare within the organization may become more informative than benchmarks.

## Considerations for updating benchmarks

Updated benchmarks provide additional comparisons by standard segments, such as country or industry, and by added items that may be part of a customer’s survey feedback. Comparison trends provide valuable insights unavailable in Viva Glint benchmarks. For example, newly benchmarked diversity and inclusion items can help customers interpret the effectiveness of internal programs.

   > [!NOTE]
   >Deploying new benchmarks will retroactively impact customer reports, action plans, etc. for past surveys. It is beneficial to adopt the latest benchmark suite available, but a change in benchmark should be accompanied by a thorough internal communications approach.

## Editing a survey item can disqualify it from a benchmark 

Viva Glint has done extensive research to identify the most reliable and valid items linked to survey goals, and our benchmarks are created using the exact text from these items. Even a slight change to a question or statement can alter the meaning enough to invalidate a comparison to the benchmark. 

  > [!TIP]
  >Ensure alignment to the standard Viva Glint item text so benchmarks are truly an apples-to-apples comparison. There may be cases where slight edits to wording can be accommodated without altering the meaning; in these cases, Viva Glint will be able to apply the item to benchmark data. In cases where text is altered to sufficiently alter the item's meaning, we do not recommend keeping the benchmark. Instead, treat it as a custom item. While losing a benchmark might seem like a disadvantage, using items that are most relevant to your organizational needs and measuring progress over time are more impactful.

### Examples of when to keep or discard the benchmark 

1. Example 1: Matching the language of the business 

   - Standard: I would recommend my manager to others.
   - Modified: I would recommend my supervisor to others. 
   - Recommendation: Modifying a term in the item to make it more specific to your organizational language is acceptable.  

1. Example 2: Using synonyms 

   - Standard: The recruitment process was excellent. 
   - Modified: The recruitment process was great.  
   - Recommendation: If the replacement word is likely to be interpreted similarly, the item change is acceptable.   

1. Example 3: Altering the subject 
   - Standard: I feel empowered to make decisions regarding my work. 
   - Modified: My manager empowers me to make decisions regarding my work.  
   - Recommendation: Altering the subject in an item changes the way people respond. 

1. Example 4: Altering the meaning 
   - Standard: My manager provides me with feedback that helps me improve my performance. 
   - Modified: My manager and I have regular conversations.   
   - Recommendation: When the meaning of an item has been fundamentally altered, the change is not recommended.
