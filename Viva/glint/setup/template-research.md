# How Viva People Science arrives at engagement survey template items

Microsoft Viva Glint analyzed over 350 million employee survey responses to determine the employee experiences that were most predictive of engagement - happiness at work and willingness to recommend the company. We uncover key driver themes and use these to build survey templates. 

The result of our examination of the focus of engagement is a modernized framework (early 2022) called **People Success Elements. These elements are six constructs**: Purpose, Clarity, Growth, Empowerment, Connection, and Wellbeing. The constructs summarize the fundamental needs and expectations that are most critical to a person’s holistic life experience - not only their work experience - and that best shape an environment for high engagement.

**[Read The Elements of People Success blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-glint-blog/the-elements-of-people-success/ba-p/3791765).** Using Viva Glint solutions, our customers gain powerful insights on what drives employee engagement and can use those insights to build towards their own People Success culture.

## People Success Elements

In addition to evidence of a strong linkage between the People Success Elements and engagement, Viva People Science also finds relationships with other important outcomes that become part of our survey templates. Key findings include:

|People Success Element|Relationship to employee engagement at work|
|:-------------|:-----------|
|Purpose|Employees feeling a sense of purpose are 120% more likely to recommend their company as a great place to work.|
|Clarity|54% of employees lacking role clarity reported burnout in 2021, compared with 38% of employees with role clarity.|
|Growth|Employees who see opportunities to grow are three times more likely to say they'll remain with the company in two years.|
|Empowerment| Employees empowered at work are 2.4 times more likely to be happy at work.|
|Connection| Employees with a strong sense of belonging are six times more likely to be engaged.|
|Wellbeing| Employees who feel cared for at work are over three times as likely to be happy at work and recommend working for their organization, an increase of over 35% since 2020. Flexible work arrangements, inclusive workplaces, and work-life balance are the fastest growing priorities for job candidates since the COVID-19 pandemic began.|

## Terminology of survey items

This terminology helps you understand the Viva People Science methodology for determining survey items:

|Term |Definition|
|-----|----------|
| **Core Drivers (also referred to as Recommended Drivers)** | Items hand-picked by Viva People Science for customer use are included on templates. These items are the strongest predictors of the outcome item(s) in a survey program. We recommend customers to consider these items first when building a survey and to consider them as the best practice “short list.”|
| **Other Drivers** | Most Viva Glint programs have “other” drivers, too - items that are strong drivers of engagement that we want customers to be aware of but aren't part of the core/recommended driver selection for that program.|
