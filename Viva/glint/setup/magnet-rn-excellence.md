# Set up a Viva Glint Magnet/RN Excellence survey

Using the Viva Glint platform, organizations can view invaluable data from their Registered Nurses (RNs) and identify risks and opportunities in real-time. The solution can be launched as a standalone or added onto an engagement or company survey and analyzed alongside other engagement data.

## Get access to real-time data

Viva Glint offers the items needed for an Registered Nurse (RN) Excellence survey. The items available are approved by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) for hospitals/clinics looking to attain or maintain Magnet® status in Nursing. Magnet status is a prestigious honor, which certifies that the RNs at that entity or system are highly skilled in terms of providing great care. There are many core criteria a hospital must meet to become Magnet-certified, one of which is RN satisfaction, and together with Viva Glint, the preset survey template can help with that certification. Our RN Excellence survey was created in conjunction with the guidance and expertise of ANCC analysts and approved by those analysts in May of 2018. The survey meets all RN Satisfaction criteria laid out by current Application Manuals, as well. 

Working with the ANCC, Glint’s People Scientists constructed a survey solution that assessed the seven nursing satisfaction categories that are required for Exemplary Professional Practice Evidence of Outcomes as laid out in the EP3EO (2014 Magnet Application Manual) and the EP2EO (2019 Magnet ApplicationManual). The survey should take just 3-4 minutes to complete and was approved by the ANCC in May of 2018. 

> [!TIP]
> Choose the **Quarterly Engagement** survey template and customize it to meet your Magnet/RN Excellence needs by following the guidelines below.

## Build the survey by starting with Features in General Settings

From the admin dashboard, select the **General Settings** feature (in the *Service Configuration* section) and then select **Features**.

From the *Features* section, in **Available Survey Questions and Program Templates**, unselect all options other than **Nursing Excellence** and **Patient Safety**. 
Select **Save Changes**.

## Select the survey items

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Keep surveys short. Delete most engagement questions and replace them with the required items.

All survey items can be viewed and exported from the **Questions** page in *Program Summary* within the Patient Safety Survey template or downloaded from the **Question Library** on the admin dashboard. 

Choose items to add to your your survey template so that it resembles the 20 items in the table below, in numerical order. Follow in-platform guidance for adding items, and the images below for direction. **Always choose the item that is labeled with Magnet, if available.** In some cases, you have a choice of more items than are required; choose only the number of items required per category.
