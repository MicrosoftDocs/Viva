# Test and launch a Viva Glint 360 feedback cycle

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

Check every detail of a Microsoft Viva Glint 360 feedback cycle before selecting **Schedule Cycle.** Some 360 elements can't be edited once a 360 program is live, including:

- The internal cycle name. The external cycle display name can be changed.
- Question removals, additions, or edits.
- Subject additions after the Feedback Provider Selection End Date.

## Preview a 360 cycle

When each section of a 360 cycle is set up successfully, a blue check mark appears on sections to indicate that an admin can schedule the cycle.  

All sections of a 360 cycle must be set up, reviewed, and saved and at least one (1) subject must be added before the cycle can be scheduled.

To view 360 cycle reviews, from the cycle page, select **Actions** and then **Preview Survey** from the dropdown menu.

- Rating scales are as expected ( 1-5 or 1-7)
- Rating scale labels appear as expected
- Comments are available for rated items
- Rated items are marked as optional (recommended)
- Open-ended items display as expected
- Reporting guidance is available, if enabled
- Feedback provider category displays names
- Compentencies are mapped

## Preview the 360 report

From the 360 cycle page:

1. Select **Actions** and then **Preview Online Report**.
2. Switch from the **Insights**, **Comments**, and **All Responses** tabs to view different areas of the report.

## Schedule a 360 feedback cycle

After checking your 360 cycle's configuration, survey previews, and online report preview for accuracy, **schedule** your 360 cycle to make it available to participants.

To schedule from the 360 cycle page, select **Schedule Cycle** in the top right and select **Schedule Cycle** again in the dialog that appears:
