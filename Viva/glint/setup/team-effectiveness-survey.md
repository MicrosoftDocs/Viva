# Set up a Viva Glint Team Effectiveness Survey

The bulk of modern work is team-based. While organizations rely heavily on teams to get work done, few have measurements to evaluate the components of what makes an effective team. Most organizations focus on *individual* performance instead of seeking to understand what contributes to high *team* performance. For organizations to realize their full potential, shift the focus from who is on the team, to how they work together.

Microsoft Viva Glint’s Team Effectiveness Survey is a diagnostic assessment that shows how teams are working and communicating. Survey results provide prescriptive guidance to enhance collaboration and productivity.

## What is the best cadence for a Team Effectiveness Survey?

Setting up a Team Effectiveness Survey as a recurring, stand-alone program or as an Always-On survey allows leaders to use the program whenever it's needed.

> [!TIP]
> Repeat the survey in one-two months to check on progress made and adjust actions as needed.
