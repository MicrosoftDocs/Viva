# Communications setup in Program Summary

Notifying employees about upcoming surveys and the windows for taking their survey is essential for improving survey participation. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-intro.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to access Communications setup from Program Summary.":::

>[!NOTE]
> If you're configuring an Always-On program, skip this step.

There are two sections to set up:
- Notification Timing
- Configure Notifications

## Notification Timing

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-notification-timing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Notifications Timing section in Communications setup.":::

Send survey invites and reminders between the times that you set. Your organization's default time zone is preset in [General Settings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230744).

## Configure Notifications

The following sections display as setup actions and each field can be edited by selecting the **pencil symbol** that displays when& selecting a row.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-configure-notifications.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure Notifications section in Communications setup.":::

>[!TIP]
>When [personal email is set up](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2247991), as an optional system attribute, use **Email Settings** to send to *Company* or *Company and personal* email.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Customizing or editing invitations, reminders, and appreciation emails is currently a feature available for *new Viva Glint customers only*. Customers who have migrated from our LinkedIn platform will have this capability added shortly. We anticipate this to become available in June 2024. You will be notified.

### Editing the survey invitation

Select **Survey Start** to activate the *Survey Invitation* slider window.

Check **Send notification** to ensure that the send date is as expected.

Select the **pencil symbol** to edit the invite template and then the **eyeball symbol** to preview your changes. Follow on-screen guidance to make edits.

The language dropdown menu provides options that are preset for this program.

Note the following information:
- Edits made to the survey invitation are for this program only.
- Switching from **edit** to **preview** - and also when switching languages - automatically saves changes.
- Use only plain text if customizing this invite template. URLs, HTML, and other markdown may lead to errors and subsequent mail blocking.

### Disabling the survey invitation

If you want to include items in your survey invitation that cannot be supported on our platform (URLs, HTML, images, videos, etc.), toggle the **Send Notification** to **Off**. Be sure to send your own in-house survey invitation, including those items that Viva Glint can't support. 

> [!TIP]
> Always send your people a survey invite! Participation is essential for uncovering useful feedback.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/comms-invite-slider.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Survey Invitation slider window for the Communications setup page.":::

### Use Reminders

Set up to three reminders during the survey window and also a final reminder.

>[!TIP]
>Send two survey reminders per program. Survey takers only receive reminders if they haven't completeled their survey. 

Use the **Pencil symbol** to open the slider window and then:

- Change reminder send dates already preset.
- Preview your reminder. At this time, the reminder message can't be edited. You may change the language and preview the message in other languages.

### Add survey reminders

The dropdown menu on the **Add survey Reminder** button lets admins add reminders. After adding additional reminders, the reminders display on the Communications page with an alarm symbol in a green circle - so you'll know you've added them.

## Notifications when survey results are available

The results notification email is a one-time notification to let users know that results are available to them. The email sends to users in roles with **live** reporting access 24-hours before the email to all others (including phased access). Best practice is to make sure that roles are programmed and aligned before your survey closes. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-conversation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Team Conversations section on the Communications setup page.":::

### Editing and adding feedback conversation reminders

Conversation reminders are added by selecting  **Conversation Reminder**. You may choose to include an **+Add Overdue Reminder**.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-edit-conversation-start.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Edit Conversation Start Notification slider window on the Communications setup page.":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Access must be scheduled to be live 24 hours before the results notification email is scheduled for sending.

## Configure Nudges

Set up who in your organization can receive [Nudges](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231015) to promote continued action on feedback results. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-nudges-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure Nudges button on the Communications setup page.":::

Select **Configure Nudges** to open the **Nudges** setup page. Follow the in-platform guidance.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-nudge-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Nudges setup page on the admin dashboard.":::

## Final saving of communication edits 

After adding or editing reminder dates as needed, select the **right facing arrow** and then **Save and Continue.**
