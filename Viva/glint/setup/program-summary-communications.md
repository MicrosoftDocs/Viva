# Communications setup in Program Summary

Setting up notifications and providing translations to your programs happen in this section of Program Summary.

>[!NOTE]
> If you are configuring an Always-On program, you'll not have to complete this step.

## Understand the fields for setup

**Change Reminder Times**: Reminders are sent after the survey invitation has been sent and at different intervals while the survey is live. Reminder times are set according to the default time zone for your account.

**Language**: English is the default language for all programs initially, but the default language can be changed to any of the languages in the dropdown menu.

**Best Practice**: _Ensure that the questions (items) selected for use in your survey are available in the default language._

**Pencil Icon**: Personalize the message that goes along with any reminder you'd like to include.

## Procedure to set up communications

1. Select the desired **Notification Timing** to send invites and reminders. Be sure to select AM or PM.
2. In **Configure Notifications**, you'll see a list of predetermined email notifications and the dates the emails will be delivered. To add more notifications, select **Add Survey Reminder**.
   >[!TIP]
   > Send at least two reminders a week.
3. Select the desired notification to preview or edit.
4. In the slider panel, select the **pencil** symbol to edit the notification.
5. Enter the number **of days after survey start** to send the notification.
6. If you have **Additional Languages**, select the Language dropdown, and add languages.
7. Select **Save Changes** and then **X** to close the slider panel.
8. Repeat the process for each other language required and for each notification.
9. Select the **Survey End** pencil symbol to preview or edit what survey takers see.
   1. Turn **ON** to send notification.
   2. In the **Send** field, enter the number of days after the survey ends to send the notification.
       >[!NOTE]
       >Reporting Access configured on the Reporting page must manually be switched to "Live Access" at least 48 hours before the scheduled Survey End notification date. Survey End notification will not be delivered if access is not switched over.
   3. If desired, select the **pencil** symbol to edit the Survey End Notification. Make the necessary changes and repeat the process for each extra language being used.
   4. Select **Save Changes** and then **X** to close the slider panel.
