# Communications setup in Program Summary

Notifying employees about upcoming surveys and the windows for taking their survey is essential for improving survey participation. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-intro.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to access Communications setup from Program Summary." lightbox="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-intro.png":::

>[!NOTE]
> If you're configuring an Always-On program, skip this step.

There are two sections to set up:
- Notification Timing
- Configure Notifications

## Notification Timing

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-notification-timing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Notifications Timing section in Communications setup.":::

Send survey invites and reminders between the times that you set. Your organization's default time zone is preset in [General Settings](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230744).

## Configure Notifications

The following sections display as setup actions and each field can be edited by selecting the **pencil symbol** that displays when& selecting a row.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-configure-notifications.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure Notifications section in Communications setup.":::

>[!TIP]
>When [personal email](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2247991) is set up as an optional system attribute, use **Email Settings** to send to *Company* or *Company and personal* email.

### Editing the survey invitation

Select **Survey Start** to activate the *Survey Invitation* slider window.

Check **Send notification** to ensure that the send date is as expected.

### Disabling the survey invitation

If you want to include items in your survey invitation that cannot be supported on our platform (URLs, HTML, images, videos, etc.), toggle the **Send Notification** to **Off**. Be sure to send your own in-house survey invitation, including those items that Viva Glint can't support. 

> [!TIP]
> Always send your people a survey invite! Participation is essential for uncovering useful feedback.

### Use Reminders

Set up to three reminders during the survey window and also a final reminder.

>[!TIP]
>Send two survey reminders per program. Survey takers only receive reminders if they haven't completeled their survey. 

Use the **Penci** symbol to open the slider window and then:

- Change reminder send dates, which are preset.
- Preview your reminder. At this time, the reminder message can't be edited. You can change the language and preview the message in other languages.

### Add survey reminders

The dropdown menu on the **Add survey Reminder** button lets admins add reminders. Reminders display on the Communications page with an alarm symbol in a green circle.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-add-reminder.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add Survey Reminder dropdown menu for the Communications setup page.":::

### Customize email content

Use this email [customization guidance](email-content-customization.md) to add custom text to your Viva Glint survey emails.

## Notifications when survey results are available

The results notification email is a one-time notification to let users know that results are available to them. The email sends to users in roles with **live** reporting access 24-hours before the email to all others (including phased access). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For all users to receive a results notification, ensure that all roles are granted access (phased or live) in the Reporting section of the survey program before your survey closes. 

To set up the results notification email:

1. From the admin dashboard, go to **Configuration** and choose **Survey Programs**.
1. Select a survey and go to the **Communications** section in **Program Summary**.
1. Select the **Edit & Preview** option on the **Survey End** email.
   1. This email is turned off by default.
1. In the edit pane that appears, switch **Send notification** to **On**.
2. In the **Send** field, enter a number of days after survey end date to send the email.
   1. The default is three (3) and the maximum is 30 days.
2. Select **Save Changes** in the top right of the edit pane.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Access must be scheduled to be live 24 hours before the results notification email is scheduled for sending.

> [!NOTE]
> To edit **Team Conversations** notifications, [follow this guidance](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231273).

## Configure Nudges

Set up who in your organization receives [Nudges](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231015) to promote continued action on feedback results. 

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/program-summary-comms-nudges-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Configure Nudges button on the Communications setup page.":::
