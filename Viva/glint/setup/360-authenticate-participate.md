# Viva Glint 360 program authentication and participant experiences

Subjects and others who should have access to a subject’s 360 must first have access to Viva Glint and authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. 
Feedback providers also must have access to Viva Glint and authenticate via Microsoft Entra ID to complete the survey. 

## 360 participant experiences

A Viva Glint admin sets up the 360 but it’s helpful to first understand the 360 subject and feedback provider experience.
