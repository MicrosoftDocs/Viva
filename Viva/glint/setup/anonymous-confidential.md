# Why Viva Glint surveys are confidential but not anonymous

“Confidential” and “anonymous” are sometimes used interchangeably, but in the realm of employee engagement, their meanings are not the same, and understanding the difference is important for effective communication to your organization and other stakeholders, such as Works Councils.
-	When used with surveys, the word “confidential” means that survey results are aggregated, and, in general, the identity of the survey respondent is not disclosed.
-	“Anonymous” surveys indicate there is no way to definitively link data back to a specific individual. Anonymous survey responses have no personal data associated with it, other than specific demographic questions that may be asked during the survey itself.

## Why aren’t Viva Glint surveys anonymous? 
Viva Glint surveys are not anonymous so that accurate demographic analysis can be provided. Survey results can also be aggregated across multiple surveys and programs to provide organizations with cross-program insights, accurately tracking trends. If the survey results were anonymous, analytical capability would be severely limited.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all Microsoft Viva Glint surveys are confidential. Some are identifiable, meaning that survey responses are directly attributed to survey takers in Viva Glint reporting. [Read more about how Viva Glint help you protect your privacy.](/viva/glint/setup/viva-glint-survey-privacy)
