# Set up a Microsoft Viva Glint tenant

To deploy apps that use the Microsoft platform for identity and access management, you first need access to a Microsoft Entra ID *tenant*. In the Microsoft Entra tenant, you'll register and manage your Viva Glint apps, configure their access to data and other web APIs, and enable features like Conditional Access. 

A tenant represents an organization. It's a dedicated instance of the Microsoft Entra tenant that an organization or app developer receives at the beginning of a relationship with Microsoft. 

Each Microsoft Entra tenant is distinct and separate from other Microsoft Entra tenants. It has its own representation of work and school identities, consumer identities (if it's an Azure AD B2C tenant), and app registrations. An app registration inside your tenant can allow authentications only from accounts within your tenant or all tenants. 

When a new customer purchases Viva Glint, they're entitled to the Viva Glint product, and tenant provisioning should occur within days of the purchase. Customer instances can be hosted on Viva Glint’s US or EU server. 

## Customers entitled for Viva Glint provisioning 

- Net new Viva Glint standalone customers
- Viva Suite customers
- LinkedIn Glint standalone customers
- Existing Viva suite and LinkedIn Glint customer

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A Viva Glint tenant is not available for GCC/GCC H entities as it is intended for commercial services only.
> - A minimum number of 100 active user licenses are required for tenant provisioning. Licenses requested below 100 will prompt a screen message and email to inform you to contact your Microsoft Account Manager or adjust the number of licenses purchased in the Microsoft Admin Center, if you purchased via our self-serve checkout flow. 

## Begin your Viva Glint provisioning experience

Choose either the US or EU URL for Azure login to begin:

- US - [http://app.us1.glint.cloud.microsoft](http://app.us1.glint.cloud.microsoft)
- EU - [http://app.eu1.glint.cloud.microsoft](http://app.eu1.glint.cloud.microsoft)

>[!TIP]
> If you are unsure which URL to choose, begin with the US URL.

## Complete the Welcome to Viva Glint page

After logging into your preferred URL, the Welcome to Viva Glint page displays. Check the box for notification to be sent if you would like to receive email notification once your tenant provisioning is complete. Select **Continue** to begin tenant provisioning.

>[!NOTE]
> Tenant provisioning can only be initiated by the Tenant Global Administrator. 

Dependent upon whether you have chosen to receive notification, one of the following screens will open: 

- With notification requested, these messages display: 
    - We’ll notify you when it’s ready.  
    - We’ll add tenant global administrators as your default Viva Glint service administrators. You can update this or add more Viva Glint service administrators within the product anytime.  
    - Select **Learn more** to be taken to post-provisioning next steps while your tenant is getting provisioned. 

- Without notification requested, these messages display: 
    - Check here later to see if it’s ready. Allow a couple of days for this step. 
    - We’ll add tenant global administrators as your default Viva Glint service administrators. You can update this or add more Viva Glint service administrators within the product anytime. 
    - Select **Learn more** to be taken to post-provisioning next steps while your tenant is getting provisioned.

### What if I run into an error?

If your tenant can't be provided, you'll receive this message. Select **Request support** and a tab will open for Microsoft 365 support.
