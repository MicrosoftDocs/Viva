# Access Viva Glint raw survey responses

## What are raw survey responses?

In Microsoft Viva Glint, "raw survey responses" refers to unaggregated survey responses that are directly tied to a survey taker. By default, Viva Glint admins have access to raw survey responses and can export that data using admin controls. 

> [!NOTE]
> "Raw survey responses export" can also be referred to as "Raw data export."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customers can use program setup features to respond to users' Data Subject Rights (DSR) requests.
>
> For information on how to support a request to delete data, visit [Delete user data from Viva Glint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2236554).

## Acting on Data Subject Requests (DSRs) from data subjects 

Viva Glint admins, who are assigned by your Microsoft 365 Global admin, are in control of your organization’s data. This role – Data Controller – can act on Data Subject Rights requests from Viva Glint survey takers. [Read more about DSR obligations.](/../../viva/glint/setup/gdpr-special-categories)

>[!NOTE]
> Raw survey response export doesn't need to be enabled to fulfill these requests. Admins can send raw survey responses directly to the survey taker without gaining access and viewing this data.

## Does enabling raw survey response export make survey takers identifiable in reporting?

Export of raw survey responses is only available to your organization through admin controls. Viva Glint admins should consult with their privacy, HR, and legal teams. 

>[!NOTE]
> Reporting is aggregated for surveys with a minimum threshold of three (3) or more respondents.

## Configure raw survey response access
Your organization may not want access to raw survey responses for every survey. This data access decision could be because of the data's sensitivity, employee privacy concerns, regulatory or contractual obligations (such as Works Council agreements), or other reasons. Your role as the Viva Glint admin provides permissions for you to configure them at your discretion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When setting up each Viva Glint program, the Viva Glint admin decides whether raw survey response exports are available. Admins can change the raw response data toggle at any time during a survey program's lifecycle, but the change only applies to future survey cycles. Closed cycles are controlled by the raw response setting that admins established when the cycle launched. Raw survey export **doesn't** need to be enabled for an employee to request their personal data.

## Admins can opt out of response exports

By default, raw survey responses are available for each new program, but Viva Glint admins can opt out of response exports. 

### Procedure to opt of our response exports
Opting out of response exports occurs within the **Confidentiality** section of *Program Setup*. Program Summary is accessible from the *Survey Programs* configuration page of the admin dashboard. 

1. Select **Survey Programs** in the **Survey** section.
1. Select the survey and then **Program Setup** on the *Program Summary* page.

>[!NOTE]
> A program can't be in **Approved** status to enable this feature. As necessary, toggle **Approved** to **NO**. The default setting for **Enable Export of Raw Survey Responses** is **YES**. Toggle to NO to opt out of raw survey response export. [Read more about the confidentiality statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2238614).

To ensure customers meet their Data Subject Rights (DSR) obligations, Viva Glint provides an alternative solution, allowing customers to fulfill DSR requests without accessing the requestors raw survey responses. Read on.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even when an admin has opted out of raw survey response exports, the Glint admin can still access data if it meets **extreme circumstance** criteria. It's possible that Glint needs to disclose survey feedback when there is a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect your safety, the rights and safety of Glint personnel or others, or to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected illegal activity, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or if otherwise required by law to do so.

## Use the People feature to export responses

   2. In the **Send User Data** slider, all attributes from your HRIS file are preselected.
      1. Select **Clear All** and then select the attributes you want to export, or

## Disable Raw Data Export access

**Important**: Disabling Raw Data Export (RDE) means that: 
- Admins can't access or export this survey data unless your organization believes extreme circumstance requirements exist. In this case, a Viva Glint admin can enable the export.
- Microsoft won't facilitate direct transfers to third parties, such as alternative survey platforms or data analytics consultants.
- The customer remains the data controller and Microsoft permanently prohibits customer access to non-RDE survey data at the *customers' explicit instruction*.
