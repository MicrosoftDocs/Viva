# Preview and filter Employee Lifecycle programs 

## Approve your program 

When each section of a Viva Glint Employee Lifecycle survey is set up successfully, a blue checkmark displays next to the section name on the **Program Summary** page. The survey can now be approved and enabled. 

To approve a program, toggle the Approved button to **YES**. 

## Preview your survey  

Once your program is approved, preview the survey to test the user experience. 

### Preview the survey 

1. Hover over the box with the survey name and select **Preview**. 
2. Select a user to generate a survey preview.  
3. Select **Preview Questionnaire**. 
4. The introductory page of the program opens in a new tab. The default language chosen by the user displays.  

>[!TIP]
> When reviewing the introduction and summary for each item, ensure that:
> - Rating scale is as expected (1-5 or 1-7) 
> - Rating scale labels are written as expected (Strongly Disagree/Strongly Agree)
> - Comments are available 
> - Items can't be skipped, unless intended 
> - Macros appear as actual values and don't show up as macros 
> - Additional Language options are available as expected 

## Preview the survey invitation  

Preview a survey from an invitation email. Use this preview email to ensure surveys are received and don't end up in a spam or junk folder. 

1. Use the vertical ellipses next to the survey name to select **Preview**. 
2. Select a user to generate a survey preview and email invite.  
3. Select **Send a sample pulse invite**.  
4. Select **Preview Questionnaire**. 
5. Check your email for your survey invite. 
6. Review the email content and select **Provide Feedback**. The welcome page of the survey opens in a new tab, in the chosen language of the user you're previewing. 

## Enable an Employee Lifecycle program 

After a survey is approved, it must be enabled to go Live on the scheduled date. Surveys move to Live status at midnight on the scheduled start date, in the default time zone. 

1. Use the vertical ellipse next to the survey name to **Enable Survey**. 
2. Select **Enable Survey** (again).  
3. The **Status indicator** changes to blue. If the survey is Live, the Status indicator is green. 

## Employee Lifecycle reports are unique 

Employee Lifecycle reporting behaves differently than recurring program reporting. [Learn more about using the trend graph in Employee Lifecycle reports](/viva/glint/reports/trend-graph-lifecycle-survey).
