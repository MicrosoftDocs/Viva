# Preview and filter Employee Lifecycle programs 

## Approve your program 

When each section of a Viva Glint Employee Lifecycle survey has been set up successfully, a blue checkmark displays to the right of the section name on the *Program Summary* page. The survey can now be approved and enabled. 

**Procedure** 

To approve a program, toggle the Approved button to YES. 

## Preview your survey  

Once your program is approved, you can preview the survey to test the user experience. 

### Preview the survey 

1. Hover over the box to the left with the survey name and select the **Preview** option. 
2. Select the user whose survey you will preview.  
3. Select **Preview Questionnaire**. 
4. The introductory page of the program opens in a new tab, in the default language of the selected user.  

>[!TIP]
> When reviewing the introduction and summary for each item, ensure that:
> - Rating scale is as expected (1-5 or 1-7) 
> - Rating scale labels are written as expected (Strongly Disagree/Strongly Agree)
> - Comments are available 
> - Items are not skippable unless intended 
> - Macros appear as actual values and do not show up as macros 
> - Additional Language options are available as expected 

## Preview a survey invitation for an Employee Lifecycle program 

Preview a survey from an invitation email. Use this preview survey email to ensure surveys will be received by your employees and do not end up in a spam or junk folder. 

**Procedure** 

1. Use the vertical ellipses next to the survey name to select **Preview**. 
2. Select the user whose survey you'll preview.  
3. Select **Send a sample pulse invite**.  
4. Select **Preview Questionnaire**. 
5. Check your email for your survey invite. 
6. Review the email content and select **Get Started**. The introductory page of the program will open in a new tab, in the default language of the user you're previewing. 

## Enable an Employee Lifecycle program 

After a survey is approved, it must be enabled to go Live on the scheduled date. Surveys move to Live status at midnight on the day it's scheduled to go out, in the default time zone. 

1. Use the vertical ellipse next to the survey name to **Enable Survey**. 
2. Select **Enable Survey** (again).  
3. The **Status indicator** changes to blue. If the survey is Live, the Status indicator will show green. 

## Employee Lifecycle reports are unique 

Employee Lifecycle reporting behaves differently than that of Viva Glint's recurring programs. [Learn more about using the trend graph in Employee Lifecycle reports](/viva/glint/reports/trend-graph-lifecycle-survey).
