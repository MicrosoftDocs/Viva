## Competencies

Competencies are a set of verifiable characteristics and skills that enable and improve the efficiency of performing work. 

- A Glint 360 cycle can include a maximum of 150 competencies. 
- The typical number is in the range 3-10. 
- Except for the Competency Name and Description, competencies can't be added or deleted once a cycle is live. 
- Competencies map only to ratings questions. 
- The Glint Manager 360 template includes 13 competencies mapped to template rating questions. 
- To go live, a cycle must have at least one competency-question mapping. Each competency must map to at least one question.

## Develop a competency model

Develop a competency model which is relevant to the success criteria for your organization. Follow these recommended steps:

- Collect information on what is considered success behaviors.
- Draft critical behavioral statements.
- Validate the competency model by comparing 360 results to desired business outcomes. 

Repeat this process for each major demographic.

## Question mapping

To maximize the reporting experience, map all ratings questions to at least one competency. Although a competency can map to more than one rating question, a rating question can map to only one competency. 

Procedure to map a competency to a question that is already mapped to another competency:

1.	Go to the other competency and remove its mapping to that question
1.	Return to the other competency to map the question.

### Customizing a competency and mapping it to a question
