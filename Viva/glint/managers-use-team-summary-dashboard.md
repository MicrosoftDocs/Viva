# Managers using the Team Summary dashboard in Viva Glint

The Team Summary manager dashboard experience displays results from the most recently closed program. You can choose to see results from previous programs as well. 
The following guide describes each section in the manager dashboard. 

## Understand the survey title card 

The title section includes:

- The current survey title that you have chosen 
- The date the survey closed or is closing on: For Recurring and Ad Hoc surveys 
- Viewing window: For Employee Lifecycle and Always-On surveys 
- Settings button: For filtering comparison and outcome items 
- Switch Program button: For changing to view another completed program

## Manager Concierge visibility

Your manager sees the following four steps: 

1. Step 1: Give feedback 
1. Step 2: Interpret results 
1. Step 3: Discuss with your team 
1. Step 4: Commit to next steps 

## What else will your manager see on their dashboard? 

The manager dashboard defaults to showing the results from the most recent survey program. Switch to another program by using the **Switch Program** drop down menu.

### Survey participation 

In this section, you'll see 

- Response Rate: The percentage of how many team members responded to the survey, compared to a benchmark response rate.
- Comments: The number of comments overall, which question received the most comments and the opportunity to view the comments (if the confidentiality threshold has been met). You can drill down to see comments, but we recommend reviewing reports at a high-level first. 

### Celebrations

Managers may see an animated Celebrations display if there are positive trends or the number of items above benchmark have improved compared to past reports. Celebrations don't show in an initial survey.

Extra factors are considered when populating this section. 

The table below helps to understand them:

|Improved Score type |Compared to |Minimum Response Count and score difference|Celebration message|
|------------|-------|-------|-------|
|Focus Area  |Previous survey |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br> |Our team Focus Area increased by  [#] points from [month, year] from the survey where this question was previously asked!|
|Focus Area |All historical data (from at least two historical surveys) |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br><br>|Our team’s [key outcome] score has trended up over the past [#] surveys!| 
|Key Outcome (e.g., Engagement) |All historical data (from at least two historical surveys) |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br><br>|Our team’s [key outcome] score has trended up over the past [#] surveys!|
|Questions |Selected benchmark |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br><br>|Our team’s scores for X questions are above [the company’s/the benchmark/all my teams]! |

   > [!NOTE]
   > Users with Live reporting access may see confetti fly before the survey is closed and that conclusion may not be indicative of actual results when the survey is completed. Keep in mind that the Celebrations section is not party-worthy until your survey is closed!

### Overview

This section contains the metrics for the key outcome of the survey. The number in the blue box is the overall result for this survey.

In this section, you'll also see: 

- Trend survey: Your current score versus any previous scores. Keep in mind that trend results won't be available for the first survey.
- Your team score compared to the Company score. To view your team score in comparison to the external comparison score (outside your organization), use the **Settings** button to switch to **Benchmark**. The Benchmark may be global, or it may be industry or location specific. Your administrator made this choice when setting up your survey program. 
- Favorability breakdown of responses to your key outcome question - on a 5-point scale (recommended), favorability is based on the following response scores:

    - A score of 4-5 indicates favorable: Blue 
    - A 3 indicates the responder was neutral: Gray 
    - A score of 1-2 indicates unfavorable: Red    

Use the right-facing arrow to drill down for more information and suggested actions for each item. 

## Scores   

### Overview

Strengths and opportunities are derived from a manager’s Driver Impact report.

The following colors are used:

- Blue: Strength

### Top Strengths

The Top Strengths are as follows:

- Up to three high impact strength scores with their correlating driver and survey item 
- Benchmark comparison where applicable
- Link to comments 
- A video selected by your admin that will enhance your attention to your team’s strengths. Videos are available in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil), Simplified Chinese, Italian, Polish, Turkish, and Russian.
