# Customize action plans 

Suggested Action Templates contain content that Microsoft Viva Glint has included as suggested action items to help managers achieve Focus Areas with their teams. Action Plan templates live in Content Resources within Action Taking on the admin dashboard. 

## Understand terminology associated with action plans 

The following terminology assists with understanding how Viva Glint determines action plan templates: 

- **Driver**: A factor that affects employee engagement, such as growth or culture. Survey items are developed to surface engagement drivers.
- **Suggested Action Templates**: The overall template associated with a survey item. Managers choose a **Focus Area** via the **Take Action** command within survey results and are then directed to the Suggested Action Template associated with that chosen key driver.
- **Suggested Action Items**: The components of a Suggested Action Template. 
- **Content Resources**: Articles, images, PDFs, and videos that make up Suggested Action Items. 

## Specifications for adding Content Resources 

All content that exists in Content Resources is considered Viva Glint standard content. Content may exist as articles, images, PDF files, or videos. Content must first exist or be added in Content Resources before it can be attached to a Suggested Action Template.

**Following is the character limit guidance for adding Content Resources**: 

| **Field** | **Character limit** | 
|---|---|
| **Name** | 100, no spaces |
| **Title** | 2048|
| **Description** | 50 K+ |
| **Rich text** | 50 K+ |
| **Image file name** | 255, include file extension |
| **PDF file name** | 255, include file extension |
| **Video link URL** | 5048 |

## Adding external links to Content Resources 

1. From the Viva Glint admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Content Resources**. 
1. Select **+ New**. 
1. Select **I Understand**, indicating that you understand that adding a new item adds it for all languages. 
1. Add a title in the Untitled Resource section, select the **Resource Type** from the dropdown box, and add a description. 
1. Follow the on-screen guidance for adding the resource. 
1. Select **Save**. 

## How to clone customized standard content 

Edited content must be renamed before it can be saved and published. This step is referred to as creating a clone so that original content is never altered. In the Shared column, the content indicated as **Shared** is Viva Glint standard content. In the **Last Modified** column, standard content is indicated by *Viva Glint Admin*. New or customized content will be classified as Custom in the **Shared** column and *Your Name* in the **Last Modified** column.

## How to add LinkedIn Learning videos to Content Resources 

Dozens of LinkedIn Learning videos are already linked to Viva Glint templates. If you’re already a LinkedIn Learning customer and want to add different course content to your Viva Glint template, check out [LinkedIn Learning Customer Success: Course Content Corner](https://learning.linkedin.com/customer-success-center/linkedin-learning-course-content-corner?lr=1).

## Link a new survey item to a Suggested Action Template 

Most standard survey items are automatically linked to a Suggested Action Template by default. You can, however, edit an existing template by linking new items to it. This creates a new template (clone) that you'll rename. 

**Procedure**

1. From the Viva Glint admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action Templates**. 
1. Choose the template you want to add an item to from the **Name** column. You see the item(s) already linked to the template. An item may appear twice if the item scale was different between surveys. Hover over the item to see where the item was used, and the point scale assigned to it. 
1. Select the **pencil** symbol to edit. 
1. Use the search bar dropdown menu to **find the new question**. Type in the key driver or a few words from the item to find it.
1. Select **Update**. The new item will now appear in the **Questions** section.
1. Select **Save**. The *Create new Suggested Action Template* name box displays. Remember, this is so the original template isn't altered.
1. Insert a name that resonates with you for ease of finding later. 
1. Select **Done**. *The new Suggested Action Template will now appear as a Custom template*.


   > [!NOTE]
   >Suggested Action Templates update in real time. Often standard survey items are shared across multiple survey programs. You may be updating a template currently in use. Be sure that the addition will be useful to any user who has chosen that template as a Focus Area. 

## Edit a suggested action item 
   
**Procedure**

1. From the admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Suggested Action**.  
1. Select the template from the **Name** column. 
1. On the template page, under Suggested Action Items, tap the action to be edited and select the **pencil** symbol. 
1. On the **Resource** page, edit the title, add to, or edit the description, add, or edit video link. 

## Move a suggested action item 

**Procedure**

1. Tap the action item to be reordered. 
1. Use the three horizontal lines to drag and place the item elsewhere in the list.  

## Delete a suggested action item
  
**Procedure**

1. Tap the action item to be deleted. 
1. Select the **trash can** symbol. 

## Add default action items to a Suggested Action Template 

Default Action Items will automatically appear anytime a new Focus Area is created for that item. For any Suggested Action Item that your company wants users to review, tap on the item and select **Move to Default**.
