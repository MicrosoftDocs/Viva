# Viva Glint Do-It-Yourself Insights Review template

## What is the Do-It-Yourself Insights Review template for?

Use the Viva Glint platform live when presenting results to your leaders. If you do need to create your own presentation, this deck guides you through that process and helps identify and summarize key insights.

## Think like a Microsoft Viva People Science Consultant

Use the guidance on slides three and four to construct the best presentation for your organization.

> [!TIP]
> Yellow boxes on each slide provide guidance as you put the deck together. *Delete the yellow boxes prior to sharing the presentation!*

> [!TIP]
> Use the desktop PowerPoint app rather than the PowerPoint web browser for a better editing and viewing experience.

> [!TIP]
> If manually entering data into your deck, double check your numbers! Our sample slides include data showing where to insert your results. Confirm everything is accurate; it sometimes helps to have another set of eyes confirm the data! 

## Make a great executive presentation

A great executive presentation is short and tells a focused story. The presentation leads to rich conversation and action taking rather than an exhaustive review of data and figures. 

### Best practices

Review one to two areas of focus only, then move swiftly to action taking with accountability, ownership, and next steps defined.

Use the ACT framework to outline your presentation:

#### Acknowledge

- Present a high-level overview of your results and then move into key themes, which are usually a deep dive on opportunities to improve. We suggest showing no more than 1-2 opportunities from your survey. 

- For each survey theme, use one or two slides to tell your story. Pairing quantitative data (like item scores, heatmaps or alerts) with comment examples brings your story to life. 

- Consider using external comparisons. Visit Viva Glint's blog to incorporate aggregate data into your presentation. Wellbeing survey items are a great source of insightful and timely information. 

Rather than relying only on this PowerPoint deck for your conversation, use a few slides and then move into the live platform to uncover insights with your group.

> [!TIP]
> Save reports for specific survey items with filters applied as you go! 

#### Collaborate

- Facilitate a conversation around selecting one area to focus on as a group.

#### Take one step forward

- During this section, the facilitator should assign next steps, roles, and responsibilities.
