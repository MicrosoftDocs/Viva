# Communicate pre-launch and live Viva Glint program information using email templates

Communicating survey expectations and results is an essential part of a strong engagement program strategy. 

Use the pre-launch and live templates below to customize and send to the people in your organization to prepare them to participate in Viva Glint survey programs. The templates are for guidance only and assume a six-week launch, which may be longer than your timeline. Align your communications as appropriate. 

Sample communications aren't generated in the Viva Glint platform. 

Various templates are available: 

- Presurvey templates for introducing various audiences to the Viva Glint survey process 
- Presurvey templates for various times prior to survey launch 
- Templates to provide leaders to training access 
- Survey reminder for when your survey is live 

## Tips for using Viva Glint templates 

- Customize the content in your voice. Look for placeholders, like [Company name], and insert applicable information. 
- Adapt messages based on your organization’s familiarity with engagement and the survey process. Organizations new to engagement may want to include more context in messages than those who survey regularly. 
- Condense the communication cascade as much as possible. Be cautious of information overload.  
- Consider the timing of other company-wide initiatives and communication plans. Look for opportunities to align communication and streamline employee touch points.

You will have the opportunity to provide input during this phase to ensure our final program is tailored to **[Company Name]**’s unique environment and delivers valuable and actionable insights.

You will be asked to be the voice of your stakeholder group by representing their perspectives throughout the day. To prepare, please consider the following questions with your stakeholders in mind:
