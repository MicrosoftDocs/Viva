# Promote Viva Glint programs and trainings

Communicating survey expectations and results is an essential part of a strong engagement program strategy. 

To prepare your people to participate in Viva Glint survey programs, use Glint's pre-launch and live-window templates to customize and send to the people in your organization . The templates are for guidance only and assume a six-week launch, which may be longer than your timeline. Align your communications as appropriate. 

Sample communications aren't generated in the Viva Glint platform. 

Various templates are available: 

- Presurvey templates for introducing various audiences to the Viva Glint survey process 
- Presurvey templates for various times before your survey launches
- Templates to provide leaders to training access 
- Survey reminder for when your survey is live 

## Tips for using Viva Glint templates 

- Customize the content to your voice.
- Look for placeholders, like [Company name], and insert applicable information. 
- Adapt messages based on your organization’s familiarity with surveying. Organizations new to engagement surveys may want to include more context in messages than organizations who survey regularly. 
- Condense the communication cascade as much as possible. Be cautious of information overload.  
- Consider the timing of other company-wide initiatives and communication plans. Look for opportunities to align communication and streamline employee touch points.
