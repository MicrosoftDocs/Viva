# Communicate results rollout plans for Viva Glint programs using email templates  

Communicating survey expectations and results is an essential part of a strong engagement program strategy. 

To act on feedback from your Microsoft Viva Glint programs, use the results rollout templates to customize and send to your people. The templates are for guidance only and assume a six-week launch, which may be longer than your timeline. Align your communications as appropriate.  

Sample communications aren't generated in the Glint platform. 

## Tips for using Viva Glint templates 

- Customize the content in your voice. Look for placeholders, like [company name], and insert applicable information. 
- Adapt messages based on your organization’s familiarity with the feedback and reporting process.  
- Condense the communication cascade as much as possible. Be cautious of information overload.  
- Consider the timing of other company-wide initiatives and communication plans. Look for opportunities to align communication and streamline employee touch points.  

Security, Privacy, and Compliance are core principles at Microsoft. We value, protect, and defend data privacy.

## Survey results and next steps for managers

**To**: [Manager]

**From**: **[First and Last name]**, Human Resources/Direct Manager/Other </br>

​
**Subject**: **[Name]** Survey results and next steps​

**Date**: [Day 1 post-survey]

Dear **[Manager First name]**,​

You are probably eager to see the feedback data from your recent Glint survey and to share these results with your team. Because **[Company name]** knows response data is impacted by how safe employees feel in providing feedback, minimum response thresholds were assigned to uphold the confidentiality of your team. If this minimum confidentiality threshold was not met - *the number of responses required so that it is not possible to determine who said what* - some of your results may not include data.​ 

Additionally, if you had fewer than five employees participate in the survey, your team won't have a results report. To protect confidentiality, your team’s data rolls up into the next level, so your team is represented in your direct manager’s report. Let your manager know that you didn't receive your own survey results and would like to use the Broader Team Insights (BTI) results as a starting point for your team’s conversation. Your manager can share BTI results with you in a PowerPoint or a PDF download. Proceed with your conversation using the rollup results from the broader team and steer the conversation toward results pertinent to your group. ​ 

Survey scores are a starting point for a conversation that involves your team in identifying focus areas to improve engagement. Even if you have just a few responses, or limited views of your results, you can still foster a rich conversation with your team. ​ 

Please reach out as needed.​

## Results rollout progress update 

**To**: Managers​ 

**From**: **[First and Last name]**, Chief Human Resource Officer or Senior Human Resources Business Partner​ 

**Subject**: **[Company name]** Survey results and next steps​ 

**Date**: [Week 4 and Week 8 post-survey close]​ 

Dear **[First name]**,​ 

Our **[Name]** survey is just the starting point to open a rich dialogue with your team. Use your results as the basis for ongoing conversations that lead to continuous improvement over time.​ 

The ACT conversation tools within Glint help you work together on areas that make a difference in your team’s performance and employee engagement by:​ 

- Giving directions to keep the team on track and avoid going too broad or deep 
- Providing guidelines for prioritization and decision-making. 
- Seeking out differing opinions and ensuring all voices are heard.
- Overcoming organizational constraints, like policies, work structures, or budget constraints 
- Connecting teams to broader priorities and groups working on similar challenges​

**Take Action** ​ 

Acting is the largest scale missed opportunity most organizations face. Employees who don't believe action will be taken are more likely to report being disengaged compared to those who believe action will be taken. Acting in a focused way can ensure long-term success.  

We don’t have to fix everything that comes out of feedback right away. Instead, let's use this opportunity to have meaningful conversations, commit to one simple change, share lessons learned, and then repeat the process.​

**Date**: [5-7 days post-survey close]​

Dear **[First name]**,​

**ACT framework**​ 
How do you effectively share **[Name]** Survey results and involve your team to prioritize Focus Areas and identify solutions? Use Viva Glint’s ACT Conversation Guide to help you prepare and facilitate your discussion:​ 

- **Acknowledge** where we are​
