# FAQs for survey participants

The following FAQs are included on this [Microsoft support page for survey takers](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-to-take-a-viva-glint-survey-6691b3c7-d7f4-48f5-a69f-d1fe5ce528a5). You may choose, instead, to customize these FAQs and share them independently. Consider also including:

- How users are eligible (for example, active employees who are with the company for at least 30 days)
- How to contact your IT department if they have issues logging in
- The survey start and end dates
- Which email address the survey emails come from
- How to receive an invite again with the [resend survey link](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2261143), **filled in with your company ID**

### What will the survey process look like?
You receive an invitation to the survey.  Employees with company email accounts receive a link by email. Employees without company email addresses or computer access receive survey access onsite. You are notified when the survey starts and how long you have to complete it.
It should take no more than 10 minutes to complete and your responses are confidential. For the best results from your organization, complete the survey with honest, thorough feedback. 
Once the survey closes, your feedback is analyzed. Your manager shares results and host a conversation about which actions to prioritize. Be prepared to share ideas about solutions that you believe can fuel progress over time.

### What is the survey window?
The survey window is the time from the day the survey opens until the day it closes for participation. If your survey isn't yet submitted near the end date, you receive a reminder. 

### Can I start my survey and complete it later?
Yes, the survey automatically saves your answers and then you can select the same link to complete it later.

### Can I change answers after submitting my survey?
If your company enables the ability to change your answers after submitting your survey, you can retake the survey. To restart your survey, use the link in your survey invite to be directed to the Thank You page. Note that all responses previously submitted are deleted.
If your company doesn't enable this ability, you aren't able to retake your completed survey.  

*Include this question only for programs that have the Allow Survey Resubmission feature enabled in [Program Setup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2238328).*

### Why do I keep receiving reminder emails?
Reminder emails are delivered to employees who haven't completed the survey. Select the **Provide Feedback** link in your reminder email to ensure you selected all answers. When you complete the survey, you see a "Thank you" page and no longer receive reminders.

### Can I skip a question?
Unless it's noted, all questions are mandatory.

### I have a new manager and don't feel I know them well enough to rate. How should I respond?
Your opinion is always valid and is helpful for your manager to see their progress over time.

### In what languages are the survey questions available? How can I view questions in a different language?
Select the language you prefer by selecting the down-facing arrow next to **Language** on the survey landing page.

### How do I know my responses are confidential?
Viva Glint's platform makes confidentiality a priority. Learn more about [how Viva Glint helps you protect your privacy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2238614).

### Which browsers are supported?

- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Mozilla Firefox
- You can also gain mobile access through iOS Safari and Android Chrome

### What do I see if an admin edits a question during a live survey?

If a Viva Glint Admin edits a question during a live survey, admins can send users who started or completed a survey an email notification. To view the edited survey question, use [retake survey steps](#can-i-change-answers-after-submitting-my-survey) to resubmit your responses.
