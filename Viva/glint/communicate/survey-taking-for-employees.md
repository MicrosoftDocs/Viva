# Introduce Viva Glint survey taking to your employees

To ensure a successful survey process, we suggest you email your employees to make them aware of an upcoming survey, explain why taking a survey is important, and share FAQs with them. To assist you with introducing the survey, use the sample email in this article.

## Introduce the survey with this email template

Use the email template provided [here](#sample-template) as the first of your survey communications. Customize the template to capture your program's brand, voice, goals, and plans. The template is written with these goals in mind:

- To drive buy-in and a high response rate by sharing:
  - What's in it for employees
  - Timing
  - Ease and confidentiality of participation
  - Your organizational culture, values, and brand
- To reduce the burden on Human Resources by providing answers to anticipated questions or challenges

### Sample template
