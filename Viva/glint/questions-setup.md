# Set up Questions page

The Questions page allows you to add or modify the items included in a survey. If you selected a default template, Glint recommended items prepopulate. Refer to the "Setting up Survey Items" lesson to add or modify survey items.

## Use Viva Glint's prepopulated survey template

Standard templates provide prepopulated questions and items, along with an introductory and "thank you" page for users. You may customize any of these.

### Edit survey introduction

Customize the introduction message for the survey by hovering over the box with the "Hello" message and select it. In the window that opens you can:

- Select languages
- Edit the greeting
- Edit the text content

When you have finished, select **Save Changes**.

## Edit individual questions (items)

Hover over the vertical ellipses next to the question to select one of the following:

### Edit Targeting

Adding a target to a specific question ensures that only the population targeted sees it within the survey. Using the search boxes, select a User Role to include or exclude. When finished, select **Save Changes**.

### Edit Question

Changes you make here will instantly propagate to all programs that use this question. In this section you can:

- Select languages
- Select the question (item) type
- Edit the default text
- Change the reporting label
- Provide instructional text
- Select whether to label for all options
- Illustrate the rating scale
- Allow or disallow comments
- Make the question (item) optional
- Map the question to a Suggested Action Template

When finished, select **Save**.

### Delete

Remove this question (item) from the program.

### Edit 'Thank You!'

Customize the 'Thank You!' message for the survey by hovering over the box with the "Thank You!" message and select it. In the window that opens you can:

- Select languages
- Edit the greeting
- Edit the text content

When you've finished, select **Save Changes**.

## Add questions to a survey cycle

You can add questions to specific question cycles by selecting the corresponding question cycle number next to the question. For example, if you only want a certain question asked on the first survey, deselect all numbers except for 1.

>[!TIP]
> Do not edit our standard survey items. Item edits may impact language translations and the item's intention, which would affect the accuracy of the benchmark tied to the question. Custom items are not mapped to external benchmarks.
