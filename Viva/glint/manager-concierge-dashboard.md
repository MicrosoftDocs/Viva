# Use the Manager Concierge dashboard in Viva Glint 

Manager Concierge is a four-step on-screen guidance and timeline feature, which assists managers to understand survey results, share them with their teams, and take ongoing action.  

Manager Concierge is enabled per User Role at the program level in the Reporting step of Program Summary and appears at the top of a manager’s dashboard, greeting them by name. This timeline automatically updates based on when the survey closes and as the manager is sharing results and committing to next steps with their team.  

Managers who have both Manager Concierge and Team Conversations enabled, receive a guided, customized presentation kit to share with their teams in real-time and progress is recorded as it's completed. Managers can switch back and forth between steps and come back to the kit even after completion.
