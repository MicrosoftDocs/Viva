# Set up Reporting page

The Reporting page allows admins to customize how dashboards are set up and how specific roles view survey results.

In the **Program Roles** section, you'll see which User Roles have access to the survey results for this program. The dropdown menu contains User Roles that you have already created and allows you to select report settings. Each role displays in its own box.

## Procedure

To give extra User Roles access to view this program's survey results:

1. Select **Add Role**.
   >[!NOTE]
   > User Roles need to be created first to appear. Refer to [Set Up User Roles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230740).
2. Select the desired **Reporting Access:**
   1. **Live Access** : Roles have full access to results as they come in, and when surveys are completed.
   2. **Phased Access** : Roles don't have automatic access to Live or completed surveys until they're granted access by the admin, on a per program case. This access does allow retained access to previous surveys and other data inside Viva Glint programs.
3. Toggle **Concierge Visibility** to enable or disable Manager Concierge. [Visit Manager Concierge for a deeper dive.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231115)
   >[!TIP]
   > Use Manager Concierge for your manager to get the most out of their survey feedback.
4. Toggle **Broader Team Insights** to enable or disable a roll-up level of survey results that can be visible to managers if they haven't met survey confidentiality thresholds within their team. [Visit Broader Team Insights for a deeper dive](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231012).
5. Team Conversations is enabled by default. Toggle to **OFF** to disable this feature.
6. Select the desired **Dashboard Default** from the dropdown menu.
   >[!TIP]
   > Company Admin roles should have the [Executive Summary Dashboard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231010) and all others should have [Team Summary](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231210).
7. Recommended reports will prepopulate. To add extra **Report Template Access** , use the **Search** field. Select the **X** next to the report to remove a Report Template access.
8. If you need to delete a role for this survey, select **Delete Role** in that role box.
9. Repeat the steps for each extra role.

## Finish additional schedule setup

### Aggregate Indices

If adding an Aggregate Index:

1. Select **+ Add Aggregate Index**.
2. In the **Create Aggregate** panel, enter a name. For example, <Engagement\> or the name, which makes the most sense for your users.
3. In the **Search Questions** dropdown menu, search and select **eSat** and **Recommend** items.
4. Select **Save** and then **Add to Program**.
5. Select **X** to close the panel.

>[!TIP]
> Use Glint's 2-item Standard Engagement Index and no other aggregates. Glint has strong benchmarks on this measurement, which can provide insightful focus areas in results reporting.

>[!NOTE]
> When Glint's 2-item index is used, we recommend using it on every survey to ensure the capture of engagement trends to accumulate benchmark data.
