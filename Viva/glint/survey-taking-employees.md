# Introduce survey taking to your employees

To ensure a successful survey process, we suggest you email your employees to let them know that they'll be asked to take a survey. Explain our employees why taking a survey is important, and answer questions they may have during the process.

To assist you with introducing the survey and for helping users troubleshoot, provide the following to your employees:

- A sample email to introduce your survey
- A list of troubleshooting FAQs that we suggest sharing with survey takers

## Introduce the survey using this email template

Use the email template provided [here](#sample-template) as the first of your survey communications. Customize the template to capture your program's brand, voice, goals, and plans.  The template is written with these goals in mind:

- To drive buy-in and a high response rate by sharing:
  - What's in it for employees
  - Timing
  - Ease and confidentiality of participation
  - Your organizational culture, values, and brand
- To reduce the burden on Human Resources by providing answers to anticipated questions or challenges.

### Sample template

Dear [Employee Name],

[Your company name] is committed to ensuring your wellbeing, happiness, and engagement at work. We always want you to:

- Be absorbed in and enthusiastic about your work
- Find meaning in what you do
- See a connection between your strengths and your role
- Be well and healthy
- Perform at your best

For this reason, we're partnering with Microsoft Viva Glint to deliver our [survey name] survey. This first survey goes live on [date].  Surveys may take place repeatedly throughout the year.  Short, frequent surveys allow us to best turn your feedback into action and be responsive to your needs.

Thank you for your participation,

[Name, Title]

### FAQs for survey takers

We suggest customizing, then copying and sharing the following information with survey takers:

#### What will the survey process look like?

You'll receive an invitation to the survey.  It should take no more than about 10 minutes to complete and you can be assured that your responses are completely confidential. Those with company email accounts receive a link by email. Employees without company email addresses or computer access receive survey access onsite. You'll be notified of the date the survey opens and how long you have to complete it. Complete the survey with honest, thorough feedback.

Once the survey closes, we analyze your feedback. Your manager shares results and host a conversation about which actions to prioritize. Be prepared to share ideas about solutions that you believe can fuel progress over time.

#### What is the survey window?

The survey window is the time from the day the survey opens until the day it closes for participation. If you haven't completed your survey nearing its closing date, you receive a reminder.

#### I've misplaced the email with my survey link! What can I do?

Viva Glint offers an uncomplicated way to resend yourself an invitation to any Live survey. Using the appropriate URL (Uniform Resource Locator) mentioned below, replace **companyID#** with your company's Viva Glint ID. You'll then be asked to provide your email address.

- For non-EU based customers: https:// app. **us1**.glintinc.com/q/ **companyID#** /resend-pulse
- For EU (European Union) based customers: https:// app. **eu1**.glintinc.com/q/ **companyID#** /resend-pulse

If you don't receive an email within 30 minutes, there are several possible reasons:

- The email address you entered isn't an exact match with our records
- The company ID you entered was incorrect
- The survey is no longer active
- You aren't eligible for the current survey
- You have already participated in this survey

In all these situations, your company administrator is your best resource for assistance.

#### Can I start my survey and complete it later?

Yes, the survey will automatically save your answers and you can select the same link to complete it later.

#### I selected my survey and saw a "Thank you" page. Why?

This indicates that you have completed your survey.

#### I submitted my survey but would like to change some answers. Can I?

*Include this question only for programs that have the Allow Survey Resubmission feature enabled.*

Yes. Use the link in your survey invite to initiate a retake. You'll be directed to the *Thank You* page to restart your survey. Note that all responses previously submitted will be deleted. Select **here** to restart the survey.

#### Why do I keep receiving reminder emails?

Reminder emails are delivered to those who haven't fully completed the survey. Select the **Get Started** link in your reminder email to ensure you selected all answers. When you have completed the entire survey, you'll see a "Thank you" page, and then no longer receive reminders.

#### Can I skip a question?

Unless it's specifically noted, all questions are mandatory.

#### I have a new manager and don't feel I know them well enough to rate. How should I respond?

Your opinion is always valid and will be helpful for your manager to see their progress over time.

#### In what languages are the survey questions available? How can I view questions in a different language?

Select the language you prefer by selecting the down-pointing arrow next to **Language** on the survey landing page.

#### How do I know my responses are confidential?

Viva Glint's platform makes confidentiality a priority and is GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant. Responses are combined into company and team scores, never individual scores. Your name is never associated with your responses and if there are too few respondents within a team, that team's responses are hidden altogether so that it would be impossible for someone to guess as to who said what.

#### Which browsers are supported?

- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Mozilla Firefox
- You can also gain mobile access through iOS Safari and Android Chrome.
