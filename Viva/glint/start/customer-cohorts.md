# Viva Glint customer cohorts

We kicked off our Microsoft Viva Glint Cohort program! Whether you're a customer new to Viva Glint or migrated to Viva Glint – all are welcome! 

The purpose of this program is to foster a collaborative learning environment where you can share knowledge, experiences, and challenges with other Glint users.  These opportunities help you learn how other like-minded companies are developing their listening programs and how they use Glint to solve organizational and industry challenges. Use this online space for you to collaborate, and once a quarter, the Glint cohort team hosts a virtual session dedicated to relevant topics, Q&As, open discussions - you name it!
