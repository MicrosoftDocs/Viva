# How Viva People Science supports Viva Glint

People Science is a research-backed and people-centric approach to the study and practice of happiness and success at work. It combines fields of study like 
- industrial-organizational psychology,
- organizational development,
- occupational psychology

with increasingly relevant fields like
- data science,
- product management,
- design.

These combinations allow reimagination of the employee experience to drive better individual and organizational outcomes.  

## Who are People Science experts?

As People Science experts, we're consultants, researchers, analysts, content authors, product consultants, and customer advocates with deep expertise in engagement and employee experience. We're a product team that scales and reaches to improve the lives of millions of people at work.

[Read What is People Science](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-viva-blog/what-is-people-science/ba-p/3946621) by Jaime Gonzales, leader of the Viva People Science Research & Development team.

## The People Success Elements

Ultimately, Viva People Science is focused on enabling people to bring their best selves to work, in order to do their best work. Years of People Science research tell us that there are **six foundational elements** that organizations should use to build effective cultures, people-centric leaders, and engaged employees. We refer to these six core elements as the [People Success Elements](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-glint-blog/the-elements-of-people-success/ba-p/3791765). 

These People Success Elements are embedded throughout the Viva research and development process and across Viva Glint survey programs, guidance, resources, and training materials. They help drive engagement, productivity, and performance.
