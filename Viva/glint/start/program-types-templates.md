# Viva Glint programs and survey types 

Microsoft Viva Glint believes ongoing, frequent communications to solicit and collect employee feedback is crucial to an organization's success. Feedback insights translate into actionable
opportunities to improve business. In today’s changing business environment, effective employee listening is critical. It equips us to navigate challenges, adapt to changes, and address uncertainty. By gathering employee feedback, we gain visibility into knowledge gaps, avoid speculation, and make informed decisions that impact both our workforce and overall business success. 

## Engagement programs

Glint offers engagement programs as a way for customers to send short, targeted surveys to their employees which deliver rich insights. Engagement is the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Engagement correlates with job satisfaction, commitment, involvement, motivation, and attrition. Viva People Science research teams continually update survey items and develops survey templates to provide meaningful insights into the current world of work.

Engagement surveys aren't just about collecting data. They're about starting conversations and taking action to improve the work environment and culture. They can be given as broad assessments or as prompts for focused, high-quality conversations and collaborative action. The goal is to understand and enhance the employee experience, leading to a more engaged and productive workforce. If you’re looking to implement an engagement survey, consider the goals, the design of the survey, and how the results can drive change. 

Glint’s approach to employee engagement provides a flexible framework using strong theoretical foundations and analyzing robust, real-time experience. Rather than a one-size-fits-all formula for engagement, Glint developed an adaptable framework and technology that suits each organization’s needs. You can make connections between the employees’ experience, how it impacts their engagement, and the resulting individual and business outcomes. 

## The People Success Elements

The experiences that drive engagement look different from one company to another.  Viva People Science research identified six core elements which capture people's needs and expectations for an exceptional employee experience companies. The People Success Elements direct you to assess and foster the experiences that matter most to people to build thriving cultures, develop people-centric leaders, and engage employees. The organizing framework provides a modern, accurate way to measure people’s evolving need for engagement and success in our new world of work.
