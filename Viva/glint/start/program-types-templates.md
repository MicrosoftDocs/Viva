# Viva Glint program types and associated templates

Viva Glint believes ongoing, frequent communications to solicit and collect employee feedback is crucial to an organization's success. Viva Glint offers engagement programs as a way for customers to send short, targeted surveys to their employees which deliver rich insights. These insights translate into actionable opportunities to improve business.

Engagement is the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Engagement correlates with job satisfaction, commitment, involvement, motivation, and attrition.

In addition to **Engagement survey programs** , Viva Glint customers can opt into **Employee Lifecycle programs.**

Our Viva People Science team continually updates survey items and develops templates to provide meaningful insights into the current world of work.

## Two categories of surveys 

Within our survey programs, there are two overarching types to consider implementing:

|Survey type|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|Organizational survey| Often administered by a global HR (Human Resources) team and sent to all employees on a recurring cadence|
|Business unit survey|Often administered by a core business team, HR team, or a local business leader with the goal of obtaining more specific information for a particular business unit|

## Survey frequency 

Viva Glint programs are available for different cadences that you set as an admin and can run simultaneously, when appropriate.

## Types of surveys

Use Viva Glint programs to create feedback habits and support continuous employee and organizational development. 

|Survey type|Description|
|---------|---------|
|Recurring engagement or special topic|Surveys should be *recurring* so that data can be compared from between cycles and *trend* can be established. Recurring surveys are set to go live at a scheduled cadence. Special topic templates include culture, manager effectiveness, and more.|
|Ad hoc|Measure something out of the ordinary at an impactful time.
|Always-On feedback|Provide feedback and suggestions anytime it feels relevant. 

Blank survey templates are available for all survey types, as well.
