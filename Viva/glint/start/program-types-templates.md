# Viva Glint program types and associated templates

Viva Glint believes that ongoing, frequent communications to solicit and collect employee feedback is crucial to an organization's success. Viva Glint offers engagement programs as a way for customers to send short, targeted surveys to their employees which will deliver rich insights that translate into actionable opportunities to improve business.

Engagement is the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Engagement correlates with job satisfaction, commitment, involvement, motivation, and attrition.

In addition to **Engagement survey programs** , Viva Glint customers can opt into **Employee Lifecycle survey programs, and 360 Feedback programs.**

Our People Science team continually updates survey items and develops templates that will provide meaningful insights into the current world of work.

## Two categories of surveys to consider

Within our survey programs, there are two overarching types to consider:

- Organizational surveys – Often administered by a global HR (Human Resources) team and sent to all employees on a recurring cadence
- Business unit survey – Often administered by a core business team, HR team, or a local business leader with the goal of obtaining more specific information for a particular business unit

## Survey frequency to consider when choosing a Viva Glint program

Viva Glint programs available for different cadences and can run simultaneously, when appropriate.

### Recurring surveys

Viva Glint offers recurring Engagement and special topic-type survey templates, in addition to a blank template from which you can create your own survey. Surveys should be *recurring* so that data can be compared from between cycles and *trend* can be established. Recurring surveys are set to go live at a scheduled cadence.

### Ad Hoc surveys

Viva Glint uses Ad Hoc surveys to measure something out of the ordinary at an impactful time. A blank template is available if you choose to create your own Ad Hoc survey.

### Always-On feedback

Use Always-On feedback to provide feedback and suggestions anytime it feels relevant. A blank survey can be created for Always-On feedback, as well.
