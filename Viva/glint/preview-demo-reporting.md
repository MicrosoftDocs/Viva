# Preview demo data in reporting before your Viva Glint survey launches

How will your employee attributes and potential survey responses look in Microsoft Viva Glint reporting? Previewing demo data enables leaders and program admins to familiarize themselves with our dashboard, understand how manager hierarchy and user file attributes appear in different reporting scenarios, and conduct manager training.

Demo surveys are available for engagement surveys only.

>[!TIP]
> Preview an upcoming survey for reporting so the survey can be edited if needed prior to launch.

## Procedure for previewing demo data reports

>[!CAUTION]
> If Nudges or Team Conversations are enabled, they must be temporarily disabled before proceeding. This ensures that no unintended notifications are sent.

1. From the Viva Glint admin dashboard, select **Configure** and then **Survey Programs.**
2. Select the survey you would like to preview.
3. On the page that opens, in the _Upcoming and Live_ tab, select **Preview** from the vertical ellipses next to the program. A _Survey Preview_ dialog box opens.
4. Select **Generate Report Preview** to view a one-time, randomized data survey report. An email will let you know when the report is available; the report may take up to 24 hours to generate. Once generated, your report remains visible for seven days.
     >[!NOTE]
     > Until you receive your email, ensure that your survey program remains in an **Approved** status. Your report will not generate successfully if your survey program is not **Approved**.
5. To make changes to your survey once you have previewed how the reporting will appear, select **Edit** from the vertical ellipses next to the program.

## Can I generate a new demo data report preview after editing a survey?

To replace a generated report, preview with newly uploaded employee attributes, a dialog box tells you that a report preview has previously been generated. To replace this demo report with the new version, select **Generate Report Preview**. The seven-day report visibility will start over with the generation of the new report.

## How do I see my demo report?

From your Viva Glint dashboard:

1. Select **Reports.**
2. Choose the **Demo Data** report.
3. Select any report to review.

>[!TIP]
> To navigate to reports for other existing survey programs, select **Switch Program** from your demo dashboard, select your program, and navigate to **Reports**.
