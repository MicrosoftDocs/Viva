# Use the Manager report in Viva Glint

The Manager Report displays a *Directs* or *Roll-up Hierarchy* view of comparisons for two different survey items. These preset items are assigned during the survey setup process and appear by default, however the Manager or Human Resource Business Partners (HRBP) can change which items are displayed by clicking the question label at the top of the column. Similar to other reports, column headers are static and can be used as a sorting feature. 

## Understand Manager report terminology 

**Directs**: Displays data for all the managers within a specific managerial roll-up hierarchy. It only displays data for those employees that report directly to the Manager.  

**Roll-up Hierarchy**: Displays data for all employees within a manager's hierarchy. This includes any employees that fall below a manager in the org chart, even if they don't report directly to that manager. In other words, more levels of the organizational chart. 

## Use the Manager Report filter 

The Manager Report has a unique filter option, which isn't present in other reports. 

Select **Add Filters**, then choose **Managers** or **Respondents**.  

The Respondent and Manager filters specify to which responses the subsequent filters will be applied. Managers will only apply those filters to managers within the employee's hierarchy, whereas respondents filter data for all respondents within the manager's hierarchy.
