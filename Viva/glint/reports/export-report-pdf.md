# Export reports as a PDF

Microsoft Viva Glint users need to export their survey results to share with offline users, read verbatim comments, or to create presentations for their teams. Exporting reports as a Portable Document Format (PDF) in Glint is quick, allows easy consumption of comments, and supports highlighting, markup, search, and preview functionality. This export technology includes PDF exports for 360 feedback program reports and Focus Area reports.

In 360 feedback reports, the PDF export experience is a valuable and primary way for reports to be shared with external coaches. Glint 360 feedback PDF reports are generated to be consumable, shareable, and easy to use for collaborating on next steps.

## Procedure to export a PDF report

1. In the **Reports** tab, choose the survey and then the report to export. You can also navigate to **Saved Reports.**  For the example in this guidance, *Overall Results* is the report to be exported as a PDF.

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/export-overall-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Overall Results report access card in Reports." lightbox="../../media/glint/reports/export-overall-results.png":::

2. As needed, filter within the report to export other cycles by selecting the **Add a filter option**. Select the cycle to export. Then **Close Filters.**

   In this example, the cycle is changed from July 2020 (the current cycle) to April 2020.

3. Closing the filters allows the report to be shown in its entirety. Now the **Export and Share** dropdown menu is available.

4. Select **Export Report to PDF**

   :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/export-share.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Export and Share dropdown menu.":::

5. A dialog box opens providing the opportunity to select which sections to include on your PDF. Only sections granted permission to the User Role display. Select **Generate PDF.**

   > [!NOTE]
   > Section selection isn't supported for Broader Team Inights (BTI) reports.

6.	A preview PDF opens in a new tab. This update displays while it’s generating:

7.	Now, choose **Export or Print** to open a new dialog box displaying report choices.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This choice brings up the appropriate dialog box for the browser you are using. Choose whether to **Save as a PDF** or to **Print** the file. Report enhancements may include printing, searching, and highlighting if your PDF tool permits. Any filters applied display

## Remove a report section before export

Default toggles are **ON** for each of these sections of the Overview report (the example report used): Overview, Questions, Keywords, Topics, Comments.
To disable a section:

1.	Select the **ellipses** in that section.
2.	Select **Remove**.

    In this example, we're removing the Overview section of the Comments report:

## Export the Comments report

1.	Select the **More** button.
2.	If the Comments report (or any specific report) isn't part of your current reporting view, from the dropdown menu, choose **+ Add section**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/export-remove-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Remove section button in Reports.":::

3.	Choose **All Comments** or whichever reporting section you choose to add. An onscreen banner notifies you that the section is added.
4.	Choose whether you want to include all verbatim comments in your PDF download. Choose either:
    - **Prescriptive comments** 
      - Content: These comments provide specific advice or instructions on how to improve or address a particular issue.
      - Purpose: They aim to guide actions and suggest concrete steps for improvement.
    - **Representative comments** 
      -  Content: These comments reflect the views, opinions, or experiences of a larger group. In short - common themes.
      -  Purpose: They aim to illustrate common sentiments or trends among the respondents
5. The **Translation** option is available here for you to use. [Follow guidance for language translations](/viva/glint/setup/language-translations).

   > When this window is closed, the default settings reset for the next use.
