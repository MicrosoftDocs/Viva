# Viva Glint's feedback reports guide

Microsoft Viva Glint reports offer an aggregate view of survey results for managers and admins in a variety of formats. Admins establish access to survey reports in the **Reporting** step of **Program Summary** for each specific User Role. Defining access status is available for recurring and ad hoc survey programs.

## Report descriptions

Admins can assign specific reports for distinct roles.

| Report name | Description | Intended for use by |
|---|---|---|
| [**Alerts**](/viva/glint/reports/alerts-report-attrition-risk) | Identifies statistically significant patterns, outliers, and deviations in your organizationâ€™s data, based on demographic attributes or combinations of attributes. Surface business critical issues or strengths that may not have been initially identifiable. | Admins |
| [**Comments**](/viva/glint/reports/comments-report)| Offers insights into employee verbatim comments, providing helpful context around survey scores. Highlights key topics, topic sentiment, topic connections, and prescriptive and representative comments. | Senior leaders, HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners), admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| [**Driver Impact**](/viva/glint/reports/driver-impact-report)| Allows managers to easily identify Strengths (areas the team should celebrate) and Opportunities (areas the team should work to improve engagement) based on key engagement driver scores. | All, but specifically managers |
| [**Executive Summary**](/viva/glint/reports/executive-summary-report) | Presents high-level data views for team presentations at all levels. This report resembles the overall dashboard view. | All |

| [**Heat Map**](/viva/glint/reports/heat-map)| Identifies high and low scoring teams on engagement and corresponding drivers. Based on permissions, these can also be filtered by demographic attributes. | Senior leaders, HRBPs, admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| [**Overall Results**](/viva/glint/reports/overall-results) | Mimics the Glint dashboard but allows data filtering and reviewing of more demographics. | All |

| [**Team Summary**](/viva/glint/reports/team-summary-enable-manage)| Captures employee feedback as an easy-to-use and insightful experience. Empowers managers to approach feedback with a growth mindset, understand unique strengths and opportunities that drive team engagement, and to encourage the next steps in sharing results and seeking team input on Focus Areas. | All |
|[**Multi-Attribute Export**](/viva/glint/reports/multi-attribute-export-report)|Deep dives into survey scores and view results of combinations for up to three attributes for admins. The Multi-Attribute Export report is available for Engagement and Employee Lifecycle surveys. | Admins|
