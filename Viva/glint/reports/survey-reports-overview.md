# Viva Glint's feedback reports guide

Microsoft Viva Glint reports offer an aggregate view of survey results for managers and admins in various formats. Admins establish access to survey reports in the **Reporting** step of **Program Summary** for each specific User Role. Defining access status is available for recurring and ad hoc survey programs.

## Report descriptions

Admins can assign specific reports for distinct roles.

| Report name | Description | Intended for use by |
|---|---|---|
| [**Alerts**](/viva/glint/reports/alerts-report-attrition-risk) | Identifies statistically significant patterns, outliers, and deviations in your organization’s data, based on demographic attributes or combinations of attributes. Surfaces business critical issues or strengths that may not be initially identifiable. | Admins |
| [**Comments**](/viva/glint/reports/comments-report)| Offers insights into employee verbatim comments, providing helpful context around survey scores. Highlights key topics, topic sentiment, topic connections, and prescriptive and representative comments. | Senior leaders, HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners), admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| [**Driver Impact**](/viva/glint/reports/driver-impact-report)| Allows managers to easily identify Strengths (areas the team should celebrate) and Opportunities (areas the team should work to improve engagement) based on key engagement driver scores. | All, but specifically managers |
| [**Executive Summary**](/viva/glint/reports/executive-summary-report) | Presents high-level data views for team presentations at all levels. This report resembles the overall dashboard view. | All |
| [**Focus Area Overview**](/viva/glint/reports/focus-area-overview-report)| Shows the status of completion of identified goals across teams. Provides critical insights briefly, with access to more details. | Admins and managers |
| [**Heat Map**](/viva/glint/reports/heat-map)| Identifies high and low scoring teams on engagement and corresponding drivers. Based on permissions, these drivers can be filtered by demographic attributes. | Senior leaders, HRBPs, admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| [**Overall Results**](/viva/glint/reports/overall-results) | Mimics the Glint dashboard but allows data filtering and reviewing of more demographics. | All |
| [**Manager Report**](/viva/glint/reports/manager-report)| Displays a *direct* or *roll-up hierarchy* view of all managers within a specific hierarchy. | Admins and managers |
| [**Response Rate Report**](/viva/glint/reports/response-rate-report)| Provides a deep dive into survey response rates across hierarchies and key demographics. Displays trends and benchmark comparisons. | All |
| [**Team Summary**](/viva/glint/reports/team-summary-enable-manage)| Captures employee feedback as an easy-to-use and insightful experience. Empowers managers to approach feedback with a growth mindset. It captures unique strengths and opportunities that drive team engagement and encourages next steps in sharing results and seeking team input on Focus Areas. | All |
|[**Multi-Attribute Export**](/viva/glint/reports/multi-attribute-export-report)|Deep dives into survey scores and view results of combinations for up to three attributes for admins. The Multi-Attribute Export report is available for Engagement and Employee Lifecycle surveys. | Admins|
