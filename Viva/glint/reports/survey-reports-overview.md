# Viva Glint’s Survey reports overview

Admins establish access to survey reports in the Reporting step of Program Summary for each specific User Role. Defining access status is available for recurring and ad-hoc survey programs.

## Report suggestions by role

Admins can assign specific reports for distinct roles.

| [Alerts](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231008) | Identifies statistically significant patterns, outliers, and deviations in your organization’s data, based on demographic attributes or combinations of attributes. Surface business critical issues or strengths that may not have been initially identifiable. | Admins |
| [Comments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=225262)| Offers insights into employee verbatim comments, providing helpful context around survey scores. Highlights key topics, topic sentiment, topic connections, and prescriptive and representative comments. | Senior leaders, HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners), admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| [Driver Impact]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231009)| Allows managers to easily identify Strengths (areas the team should celebrate) and Opportunities (areas the team should work to improve engagement) based on key engagement driver scores. | All, but specifically managers |
| [Executive Summary](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231010) | Presents high-level data views for team presentations at all levels. This report resembles the overall dashboard view. | All |

| [Team Summary](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231209)| Captures employee feedback as an easy-to-use and insightful experience. Empowers managers to approach feedback with a growth mindset, understand unique strengths and opportunities that drive team engagement, and to encourage the next steps in sharing results and seeking team input on Focus Areas. | All |
