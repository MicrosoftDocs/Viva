# Viva Glint's Survey reports guide

Microsoft Viva Glint reports offer an aggregate view of survey results for managers and admins in a variety of formats. Admins establish access to survey reports in the Reporting step of Program Summary for each specific User Role. Defining access status is available for recurring and ad-hoc survey programs.

## Report descriptions

Admins can assign specific reports for distinct roles.

| Report name | Description | Intended for use by |
|---|---|---|
| [Alerts](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231008) | Identifies statistically significant patterns, outliers, and deviations in your organizationâ€™s data, based on demographic attributes or combinations of attributes. Surface business critical issues or strengths that may not have been initially identifiable. | Admins |
| [Comments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231206)| Offers insights into employee verbatim comments, providing helpful context around survey scores. Highlights key topics, topic sentiment, topic connections, and prescriptive and representative comments. | Senior leaders, HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners), admins (anyone who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons) |
| [Driver Impact]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231009)| Allows managers to easily identify Strengths (areas the team should celebrate) and Opportunities (areas the team should work to improve engagement) based on key engagement driver scores. | All, but specifically managers |
