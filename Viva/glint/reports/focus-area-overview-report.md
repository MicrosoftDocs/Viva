# Use Viva Glint's Focus Area Overview report

The Microsoft Viva Glint Focus Areas Overview report provides a status of the completion of Focus Areas across teams. The report provides critical insights immediately with easy access to other details.  

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Your organization may use the word "goal" rather than our standard term "focus areas." For this reason, the verbiage and images on this guidance may not match exactly with your dashboard.

## Learn from Viva People Science methodology

Initiating and managing action after a survey can be an unclear process. Focused and streamlined action planning is essential. An action plan is a written commitment to make incremental improvements to the employee experience and engagement in their work, on your team, and within the company.
