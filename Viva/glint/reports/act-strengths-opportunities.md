# Use Viva Glint to act on Strengths and Opportunities

The Strengths & Opportunities (S&0) section is designed so a manager can focus on opportunities first, as they have the highest impact on employee engagement. For this reason, the option to *Take Action* appears by default in the Opportunities section. Taking action is initiated by:

- Selecting the **Take Action** button.
- Selecting the **ellipses** in the Strengths or the Opportunities column and selecting **Take Action**.

> [!NOTE]
> If there are less than two eligible items ranked, the Strengths & Opportunities section is hidden on a user's dashboard. This can happen when:
> - There are insufficient results
> - All items have low or medium impact
> - A user is on a report filtered to only one item

## Why does my screen indicate *View Focus Area* rather than *Take Action*?

When a manager has already acted - by choosing a Focus Area - the platform indicates View Focus Area. This option is to view how the manager and their team are progressing in their team conversations and action taking.

>[!NOTE]
> *Take Action* or *View Focus Area* does not appear for users without *Create Focus Areas* enabled within their role permissions.

## Understand realized vs. unrealized strengths 

Within the strengths section, you may see "realized" or "unrealized" labels or no such label. 

- Realized strength - something your team is good at and do on a regular basis
- Unrealized strength - something that your team is good at but doesn't practice regularly and should be considered as an opportunity
- Unlabeled - the gap between what is realized and unrealized, for purposes of calling out the items that deserve attention
  
## Custom Strengths and Opportunities

Outcomes and comparisons used to calculate S&Os can be customized in either of the following ways:

- Select **Settings** to reveal the option to change outcomes and comparisons.
- In the Strengths and Opportunities section, select the hyperlinked words to change the outcome or comparison.
