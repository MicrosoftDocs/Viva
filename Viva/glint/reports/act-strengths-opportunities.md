# Use Viva Glint to act on Strengths and Opportunities

The Strengths & Opportunities (S&0) report is designed so a manager can focus on opportunities first, as they have the highest impact on employee engagement. For this reason, the option to *Take Action* appears by default in the Opportunities section. Taking action is initiated by:

- Selecting the **Take Action** button.
- Selecting the **vertical ellipses** in the Strengths or the Opportunities column and selecting **Take Action**.

## Why does my screen indicate *View Focus Area* rather than *Take Action*?

When a manager has already acted - by choosing a Focus Area - the platform indicates View Focus Area. This option is to view how the manager and their team are progressing in their team conversations and action taking.

>[!NOTE]
> *Take Action* or *View Focus Area* does not appear for users without *Create Focus Areas* enabled within their role permissions.

## Understand realized vs. unrealized strengths 

Within the strengths section, you may see "realized" or "unrealized" labels or no such label. 

- Realised strength - something your team is good at and that they do on a regular basis
- Unrealised strength - something that your team is good but doesnt practice regularly and should be considered as an opportunity
- Unlabeled - the gap between what is realized and unrealized, for purposes of calling out the items that deserve attention
  
## Custom Strengths and Opportunities

Outcomes and comparisons used to calculate S&Os can be customized in either of the following ways:

- Select **Settings** at the top right, to reveal the option to change outcomes and comparisons.
- At the top of the Strengths and Opportunities section, select the hyperlinked words to change the outcome or comparison.
