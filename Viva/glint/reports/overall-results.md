As the name implies, this report shows the overall results for your survey. Drilling down, you can focus on a specific question. You can also go back to previous survey data or filter by demographic data, hierarchy data, or other attributes to gain insights about a specific group.

## Change your report settings

Filters depend on the employee data your company sends to Viva Glint and confidentiality requirements must be met to display data. 

### Use the More dropdown menu

Selecting the **More** dropdown menu gives you the option to add sections to your report and to search comments. Each option opens a new window; follow on-screen guidance.

### Use the Settings button

Choosing the **Settings** button opens the Report Settings window where you can select your internal benchmark from:

 - Company: Displays your team's scores compare to your company's scores. This comparitor is the most commonly used benchmark.
 - My Teams: Compares a single team's score to an overall score based on all of the teams you have access to. This comparison is recommended if you have more than one area of responsibility.
 - Average Question: Displays your team's scores compared to a single, overall score for all questions your team rated. Helpful if you are focused on the variance in scores within your own data, rather than comparing to another group. 

## Export and Share

Share your results with leaders and stakeholders in the way that works best for you. Select the **Export and Share** button for access to these options:
