## Change your report settings

Filters depend on the employee data your company sends to Viva Glint and confidentiality requirements must be met to display data. 

### Use the More dropdown menu

Selecting the **More** dropdown menu gives you the option to add sections to your report and to search comments. Each option opens a new window; follow on-screen guidance.

### Use the Settings button

Choosing the **Settings** button open the Report Settings window where you can select your internal benchmark from:

 - Company: Displays your team's scores compare to your company's scores. This is the most commonly used benchmark.
 - My Teams: Compares a single team's score to an overall score based on all of the teams you have access to. This comparison is recommended if you have more than one area of responsibility.
 - Average Question: Displays your team's scores compared to a single, overall score for all questions your team rated. Helpful if you are focused on the variance in scores within your own data, rather than comparing to another group. 

By clicking on “customize” you’re able to add additional sections to view on your page. You can add attributes or choose benchmarks for comparisons.

## Export and Share

Share your results with leaders and stakeholders in the way that works best for you. Select the **Export and Share** button for access to these options:
