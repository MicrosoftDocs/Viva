# Customizing Viva Glint feedback reports

Provide flexibility for users by editing, adding and removing sections of Viva Glint feedback reports. Users can customize reports by editing, adding and removing sections. Users, likely managers and HR teams, can dig into data in a way that is meaningful for them.

## Editing and deleting reports

The user selects the vertical ellipses on the report page to edit or delete a report.

### Editing a report

Choose **Edit** option to open the *Edit Section* slider window. Customization options are report specific. 

Follow the on-screen guidance using the dropdown arrows. 

Select **Done** and then return to the previous page to see the results for the new demographic. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The edited report doesn't save. The next time the report is opened, it reverts to the default report. To save, see *Saving Reports*

### Saving customized reports

To return to customized reports quickly, save the new report.

From the report page that has been customized, select the **dropdown arrow next to Export.** The *Save Report As* dialog box opens. 

Rename the new report so it is readily identifiable but does not replace the original report. Select whether or not to use the latest data.  **Yes** allows automatically updates when future surveys have results. 

Select **Save**.

### Deleting reports

If a section of a report doesn’t provide the insight the you're looking for, delete the report using the ellipses dropdown menu.

## Adding a section to a report

Any user with reporting access can add a section to a report by selecting **+ Add Section**. The *Add Section* slider window opens.

Using the top menu bar, available sections can be added to an existing report by selecting the **+ symbol** next to the section to be added. If a right facing arrow is available, choose a demographic for the new section and then select **Add.**









Edited sections can be saved under a new name to protect the integrity of the original report but so that the new report is also readily available.
