# Using the Response Rates & Access report

The Export Response Rates & Access report allows admins to download a CSV spreadsheet of managers eligible to receive survey results. The report can include those managers who are eligible, ineligible, or a combination of both. The report is available only when the confidentiality threshold is met.

Visibility into which managers have sufficient response rate data to view allows admins and program owners to target these groups with specific and appropriate messaging in advance of results rollout.

## Who can use the Response Rates & Access report and when is it available?

This report is available to anyone with program access. It can be exported when a program is live or once the survey window closes and the survey cycle is complete. 

## Export the Response Rates & Access report

Access the report from the **Program Summary** page of a Live or Completed survey cycle. Hover over the program cycle to display the horizontal ellipsis. Select **Export Response Rates & Access.**

Choose which managers to include on your download from this list:
- Have met confidentiality threshold to see results
- Have not met confidentiality thresholds to see results
- Have or have not met confidentiality thresholds

>[!TIP]
>The third option - *Have or have not met confidentiality thresholds* - is a combination of both options so it's always a safe choice!
