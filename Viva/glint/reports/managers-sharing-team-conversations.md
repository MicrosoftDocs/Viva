# Managers using Viva Glint Team Conversations

Managers use their Team Conversations Presentation Kit to launch, send, and present Team Conversations to their team. Team Conversations help managers have a meaningful conversation that moves their team forward to achieve organizational goals.

## Manager guidelines for launching Team Conversations

From the manager dashboard:

1. Select **Launch Team Conversation** (Step 3) in Manager Concierge. A customized message appears, explaining the Team Conversations presentation process.
2. Select **Get Started**.
3. Review the presentation using the slide titles for navigation. Each slide is intended to facilitate conversation with thought prompts provided.

## Sharing Team Conversations

When **Team Conversations Sharing** is enabled, team members (end users) access it through a link sent to them. The presentation looks the same as the manager's presentation but can't be edited or marked as complete. The recipient also can't forward the presentation to anyone. The presentation is in read-only format.

1. From the results dashboard, in Manager Concierge, select **Launch Team Conversations.**
2. Select **Get Started**.
3. Select the **Share** button.
4. Select **Send a Copy**.
5. Select the **Email** option.
6. **Add the email address(es)** for each employee the presentation is to be shared with. 
7. Select **Send**.

>[!NOTE]
> To receive Team Conversations, the user must have access to the User Role permission **View my Surveys**.

## Slide guidance for presenting the Team Conversations Kit

Select **Start Presentation**. This hides the page list, practices, and tips. Select **Stop Presentation** when you want to pause for conversation with your team.

Team Conversations covers the following, in your preselected terminology:

- How to have a successful meeting
- Reflections
- Data around how the team is doing
- A look at high-level results
- A look at Multiple Choice questions
- Assistance with choosing a Focus Area
- Assistance with taking small steps forward

>[!NOTE]
> Terminology may appear differently on your platform than in this guidance, depending on what terms are used by your organization.

## Team Conversations can be accessed after the conversation end date

Managers with dashboard access can review Team Conversations status at any time.

1. From the Glint dashboard, select the **My Surveys** tab.
2. There are different views within Manager Concierge:
    - If the survey is Live, Step 3 indicates **Discuss with your team**.
    - If the survey is closed, Step 3 indicates **Launch Team Conversation**. Team Conversations will generate only under these conditions:
        1. The cycle is closed
        2. The role has Live access
        3. The role's Team Conversations permission is enabled
    - When the Team Conversation is complete, **Commit to next steps** is available.
