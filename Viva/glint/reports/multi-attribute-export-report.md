# Use Viva Glint's Multi-Attribute Export report for admins 

Admins can deep dive into survey scores and view results of combinations for up to three attributes. The Multi-Attribute Export report is available for both engagement-type surveys and employee lifecycle surveys. 


## Access the Multi-Attribute Export report from the admin dashboard 

Available only to admins: 

1. Select **Reports** from the navigation menu bar.
2. Select the **Multi-Attribute Export** report tile. 

## Select up to three attributes to generate the Multi-Attribute Export file 

Attributes are available in the dropdown menu based on those sent to Viva Glint in your Employee Attribute File. Filtering this report will look a bit different for Engagement cycle reports and Always-On and Employee Lifecycle reports. When the attributes have been chosen, select **Export**.

### Filtering the export file for Engagement reports

Engagement report setup requires the *Program Cycle* date.  

### Filtering the export file for Employee Lifecycle and Always-On reports 

Employee Lifecycle and Always-On report setup requires that a Start Date and End Date be provided. 

## Access the downloaded Multi-Attribute Export file 

Once an onscreen message appears indicating that the report has been downloaded, select **Close Tab**, and open your newly generated file. 

Admins may change the three attributes selected as often as desired.
