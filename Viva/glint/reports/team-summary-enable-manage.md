# Enable and manage the Team Summary dashboard

Team Summary is an enhanced survey results dashboard for managers, which captures employee feedback in an easy-to-use and insightful way. Team Summary is compatible with all recurring and ad hoc feedback surveys.

Team Summary is designed to:
 
- Empower managers to approach feedback with a growth mindset
- Understand the unique strengths and opportunities that drive team engagement 
- Encourage the next steps in sharing results and seeking team input on Focus Areas 

## Why use Team Summary? 

The likelihood of employee feedback fueling organizational success hinges on the actions taken based on that feedback. While many companies build energy and excitement around taking the survey, momentum can slow after managers receive and view their results. This energy slow-down can happen because:

- Data can feel overwhelming and difficult to make actionable. 
- Next steps aren't always clear. 
- Engagement feedback is interpreted by a manager as only a reflection of their performance.

### Team Summary provides simple dashboard guidance for managers
