# Use the Manager Concierge dashboard in Viva Glint 

Manager Concierge is a four-step on-screen guidance and timeline feature, which assists managers to understand survey results, share them with their teams, and take ongoing action.  

Manager Concierge is enabled per User Role at the program level in the **Reporting** step of **Program Summary**. It is viewed on a manager’s Glint dashboard, greeting them by name. This timeline automatically updates when a survey closes and as the manager shares results and commits to next steps.  

Managers who have both Manager Concierge and Team Conversations enabled, receive a guided, customized presentation kit to share with their teams in real-time. Progress is recorded as completed. Managers can switch back and forth between steps and come back to the kit even after completion. 

## View Manager Concierge without Team Conversations  

Managers follow these prescribed steps, which automatically update as they progress: 

Step 1 - Give feedback: Managers receive emails or notifications to remind their teams to submit feedback. 

Step 2 - Interpret results: Using the **View Interpretation Guide**, managers see guidance for having a conversation with their team about survey feedback. 

Step 3 - Discuss with your team: Using the **Download Presentation Kit** and results from Team Summary or the Reports tab, managers can customize a slide deck to share with their team.  

Step 4 - Commit to next steps: Using **Choose a Focus Area**, managers [choose a Focus Area](https://www.microsoft.com) and then provide communications to drive sustained action. 

## View Manager Concierge with Team Conversations 

The first two steps work as they do in *Manager Concierge without Team Conversations.* 

Step 3 - Once the survey closes, the hyperlink switches from **Download Presentation Kit** to **Launch Team Conversation**. Follow on-screen guidance and [Managers Using Team Conversations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2286203). This link remains available even after the conversation is marked as complete. The kit can continue to be customized. 

Step 4 - Select **Choose a Focus Area** based on recommendations provided by the platform and insights from team discussion. For more information, see [Learn to create a Focus Area report](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2286833).
