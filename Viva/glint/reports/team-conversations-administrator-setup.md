# Admin setup for Viva Glint Team Conversations

To learn more about Team Conversation, see [Team Conversation](take-action-team-conversations.md).

## Setting up Team Conversations in Program Summary 

1. From your admin dashboard, select **Survey Programs** from the Surveys section.
1. Select the program for which you want Team Conversations to be enabled.
   
Within Program Summary, follow these procedures: 

### Program Setup page

There are two enablement options to consider on this page: 

- Enable Team Conversations â€“ Toggle to **YES**. 
- Team Conversations sharing - managers can share their Team Conversations Presentation Kit with users who have **View My Surveys** permissions. 


>[!TIP]
>Team Conversations are only generated for managers with survey results that meet confidentiality threshold requirements.  

   > [!NOTE]
   >Ensure user roles have the permissions of "View My Surveys" and "View Dashboard and Reports.

### Schedule page 

Indicate how many days the Team Conversations Window should remain open for. This drives the reminder schedule for Team Conversations. Even after the Team Conversation window has closed, users can still access their Team Conversation via My Surveys. Once set, the program indicates the conversation start and end date scheduled and how many days remain. 

>[!TIP]
>The default response window is 28 days, although the window can be set for up to 180 days. Response window refers to the number of days the survey is open to responders and is not specific to Team Conversations.  

### Reporting page 

There are two items to configure on the Reporting page for each User Role that should have access to Team Conversations. Select the down-facing arrow next to the User Role in the **Program Roles** section and then: 

1. Enable Team Conversations for that role by toggling Team Conversations button to **ON**. 
1. Select **Team Summary** as the default dashboard from the dropdown menu for that role. 

### Communications page 

Default Team Conversations email presets:  

- Conversation Start Notification: Seven days after survey results are released 
- Reminder 1: If conversation isn't done, send seven days before due date 
- Reminder 2: If conversation isn't done, send three days before due date 
- Conversation Summary Notification 
- Conversation Overdue Reminder 1: Sent three days after conversation due date

#### Rules for when to edit communications 

Emails send if these circumstances are met:
 
- Team Conversations is ON 
- The cycle is closed 
- Seven days have passed since live access
- Less than 45 days have passed since the survey close date

Emails won't send under these circumstances:
 
- Team Conversations is OFF
- The cycle is closed 
- Seven days have passed since live access
- More than 45 days have passed since the survey close date

If you enable Team Conversations for a User Role after the conversation start date, emails will immediately send once Team Conversations is switched to **ON**. 

   > [!NOTE]
   >Nudges can coexist with Team Conversations but will not send when the Team Conversation window is open.

>[!TIP]
> When Team Conversations are enabled, don't enable Nudges for that User Role.


| **Are Team Conversations on?** | **Is the cycle Live** |**Have 7 days passed since live access?**|**Can emails be edited?**
|---|---|---|---|
| Yes | Yes|N/A|Yes|
| No | Yes|N/A|Yes|

## Edit communications 

Edit and preview by selecting **Edit**. Edits made to notifications are only for the current program. Switching from Edit to **Preview** (and languages) automatically saves changes. 

### Conversation Start Notification 

- Can be enabled or disabled 
- Can be edited for the number of days after survey results are released 
- Our default and Best Practice are seven days after survey results are released

### Conversation Reminders 

Reminders begin when the User Role group gets Live access. This may be different if role groups are scheduled for Live Access at various times. The Conversation Start email can be turned on or off until the day it's sent but not after the start of the Team Conversations. An existing Reminder email (before the Conversation End date) can be deleted or modified until the day before the last group of users are scheduled to receive it. 

- Can be sent any number of days before Conversation End date. Our default and Best Practice are to send both seven and three days before Conversation End date.  
- Additional reminders can be added by selecting **+ Conversation Reminder**  
- Can be sent in any language enabled for the survey 
- Can be previewed 

### Conversation Summary Notification 

- Can only be enabled or disabled, no date changes 
- Broader Team Insights (BTI) links appear when appropriate 
- Can be sent in any language enabled for the survey 
- Can be previewed
