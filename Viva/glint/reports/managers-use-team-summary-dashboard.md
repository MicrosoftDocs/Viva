# Managers using the Team Summary dashboard in Viva Glint

The Team Summary manager dashboard experience displays results from the most recently closed program. You can choose to see results from previous programs as well. 
This guide describes each section in the manager dashboard. 

## Understand the survey title card 

The title section includes:

- The current survey title chosen 
- The date the survey closed or is closing on: For Recurring and Ad Hoc surveys 
- Viewing window, for Employee Lifecycle and Always-On surveys 
- Settings button, for filtering comparison and outcome items 
- Switch Program button, for changing to view another completed program

## Manager Concierge visibility

Your manager sees the following four steps: 

1. Step 1: Give feedback 
1. Step 2: Interpret results 
1. Step 3: Discuss with your team 
1. Step 4: Commit to next steps 

## What else does your manager see on their dashboard? 

The manager dashboard defaults to showing the results from the most recent survey program. Switch to another program by using the **Switch Program** drop down menu.

### Survey participation 

In this section, you see 

- Response Rate: The percentage of how many team members responded to the survey, compared to a benchmark response rate.
- Comments: The number of comments overall, which question received the most comments and the opportunity to view the comments (if the confidentiality threshold is met). You can drill down to see comments, but we recommend reviewing reports at a high-level first. 

### Celebrations

Managers may see an animated Celebrations display if there are positive trends or the number of items above benchmark are improved compared to past reports. The criteria for a celebration to show up is **"Our team’s scores for X questions are above [the company’s/the benchmark/all my teams]!"**, allowing Celebrations to show even in a new survey.

This table describes other factors considered when populating this section:

|Improved Score type |Compared to |Minimum Response Count and score difference|Celebration message|
|------------|-------|-------|-------|
|Focus Area  |Previous survey |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br> |Our team Focus Area increased by [#] points from [month, year] from the survey where this question was previously asked!|
|Focus Area |All historical data (from at least two historical surveys) |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br><br>|Our team’s [key outcome] score trended up over the past [#] surveys!| 
|Key Outcome (e.g., Engagement) |All historical data (from at least two historical surveys) |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br><br>|Our team’s [key outcome] score trended up over the past [#] surveys!|
|Questions |Selected benchmark |< 50 responses: Five points<br> 50-99 responses: Two points<br>100+ responses: One point<br><br>|Our team’s scores for X questions are above [the company’s/the benchmark/all my teams]! |

   > [!NOTE]
   > Users with Live reporting access may see confetti fly before the survey is closed and that conclusion may not be indicative of actual results when the survey is completed. Keep in mind that the Celebrations section is not party-worthy until your survey is closed!

### Overview

This section contains the metrics for the key outcome of the survey. The number in the blue box is the overall result for this survey.

In this section, you see: 

- Trend survey: Your current score versus any previous scores. Note that trend results aren't available for the first survey.
- Your team score compared to the Company score. To view your team score in comparison to the external comparison score (outside your organization), use the **Settings** button to switch to **Benchmark**. The Benchmark may be global, or it may be industry or location specific. Your administrator made this choice when setting up your survey program. 
- Favorability breakdown of responses to your key outcome question - on a 5-point scale (recommended), favorability is based on the following response scores:

    - A score of 4-5 indicates favorable: Blue 
    - A 3 indicates the responder was neutral: Gray 
    - A score of 1-2 indicates unfavorable: Red    

Use the right-facing arrow to drill down for more information and suggested actions for each item.
