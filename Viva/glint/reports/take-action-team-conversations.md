# Take Actions with Viva Glint Team Conversations

Microsoft Viva Glint Team Conversations feature makes the best use of the [Manager Concierge ](https://www.microsoft.com) and [Team Summary ](https://www.microsoft.com) experiences. When managers lead team conversations to share results, invite their teams to participate in prioritizing Focus Areas, and brainstorm action taking, they draw their employees into the process of improving their experience at work.  

Team Conversations brings Viva Glint’s ACT (Acknowledge, Collaborate, and Take one step forward) Conversation methodology to managers, providing them with presentation exports, Focus Area creation guidance, and links to suggested learning resources. The Team Conversations feature is compatible for all feedback surveys. 

Team Conversations results sharing is a feature available at the program level for customers and can be enabled and disabled on a per program basis.

## Have an ACT Conversation 

Team Conversations uses Viva Glint’s **ACT** conversation framework. **ACT** methodology encourages a manager and their team to consider feedback results in the following way:   

- **A**: **A**cknowledge where we are 
- **C**: **C**ollaborate on where we want to go 
- **T**: **T**ake one step forward 

## Sometimes conversations among team members can be difficult 

Managers aren't always comfortable talking about survey results because:

- They may have difficulty understanding their survey results.

- They may not feel their results are “good”.   

- They may feel the time it might take to put together a presentation is daunting. 

- They may not have confidence in their ability to facilitate a meaningful conversation.

## Why should our organization use the Viva Glint ACT framework?  

ACT framework: 

- facilitates trust, as transparency and openness are key elements of trust.
- involves employees as active participants and collaborators in reflecting on results and sharing improvement ideas.  
- strengthens ownership among the team. 

The ACT foundation: 

- is built on a combination of behavioral science and practical expertise about what fuels change in organizations. 
- encourages integration of Team Conversations into the daily flow of work, ensuring that employees feel heard, participate in determining focus areas and selecting next steps and that they leave the discussion with a sense of shared ownership. 
- targets even the most introverted employees who may not have strong working relationships with their manager.
- supports confidentiality of all conversation responses.  

## Team Conversations should exist in the flow of work   

Make Team Conversations part of the regular workday. These conversations should become the norm and not a planned conversation initiated by a meeting agenda. People within your organization with the right mindset, skills, and behaviors can learn to support this shift in conversations.
