## Edit a report

The settings button opens a window where you can choose the right comparison data to interpret survey results within the context of how others are doing. Viva Glint provides four options for comparison reporting:

- **Benchmark**: Provides a comparison point for feedback based on survey data compiled from all Glint customers. Helpful for admins and first-time survey results analysis.
- **Company**: Displays team scores in comparison to company-wide scores for the same questions. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
- **My Teams**: Compares a team's score to an overall score derived from a user’s data access. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
- **Average Question**: Presents a single, overall score for all questions and respondents within your access. Helpful for users looking for some level of variance in their score.

> [!NOTE]
> Your company may have substituted custom terms for the Viva Glint terminology used in our guidance.

## Filter a report

Most reports are filterable by attribute and hierarchy. Use the **filter** symbol.

## Add or delete a report

To add a report, select the **More** dropdown button at the bottom of the page and then **+ Add Section**. 

If you already have some reports displayed but want to add more, the More button won't be available, but you will find the **+Add Section** at the bottom of the page. 

If you choose not to share one of the reports that already appears, choose **Delete** on the vertical ellipses at the right of the report.

## Export a report
