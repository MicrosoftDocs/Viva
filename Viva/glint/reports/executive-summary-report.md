## Edit a report

The settings button opens a window where you can choose the right comparison data to interpret survey results within the context of how others are doing. Glint provides four options for comparison reporting:

- **Benchmark**: Provides a comparison point for feedback based on survey data compiled from all Glint customers. Helpful for admins and first-time survey results analysis.
- **Company**: Displays team scores in comparison to company-wide scores for the same questions. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
- **My Teams**: Compares a team's score to an overall score derived from a user’s data access. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
- **Average Question**: Presents a single, overall score for all questions and respondents within your access. Helpful for users looking for some level of variance in their score.

> [!NOTE]
