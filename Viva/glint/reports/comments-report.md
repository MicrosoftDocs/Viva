# Use Viva Glint’s Comments report 

The Comments report is your window into Viva Glint's Narrative Intelligence technology, which helps managers interpret comment data by highlighting important topic areas, sentiment analysis, and keywords. 
Reviewing comments allows managers to gain further insights into their results. Comments can provide helpful context around scores you are exploring in the rest of the application. When a comment count is present, you can select it to view the comments and interact with Viva Glint’s full Narrative Intelligence experience. Comments can be viewed by any demographic and/or question. 

## Access the Comments report

The Comments report, for those with comments permission, is found from the Viva Glint admin dashboard > **Reports** > **Comments**.

## Choose which comment sections to view on your dashboard

The Comments report is divided into sections; the Overview section displays on your screen by default.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/comments-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Comments Overview default sections."

- **Comments** - Total number of comments, defined by number of commenters and percentage of respondents.
- **Continent Sentiment** - A bar graph indicating overall positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Topics** - Topics mentioned most often appear here, including the number of mentions.

## Add additional sections to your comments report
There are two ways to add additional sections:
- Select the **+ Add section** button, or
- Use the **More** dropdown menu and then choose **+ Add Section**

Select sections by scrolling through the tabs at the top of the slider window to add sections. Add or delete sections at any time. 
- Select the **+ button** to add the section.
- If a **right-facing arrow** displays, choose that to open the window which allows you to filter by attributes. Then select **Add**.

## Questions section
This section can be viewed in either grid or table view and includes:
- Top questions by volume
- Top questions by positive sentiment
- Top questions by negative sentiment

## Keywords section
This section can be viewed by keyword view or table view. Keywords are words and phrases that occur most frequently across comments. Use this key:
- The color of each keyword indicates the aggregated sentiment or favorability of related comments.
	- Blue = positive
	- Grey = neutral
	- Red = negative
- The *size* of a keyword reflects the volume of related comments.
- Hover over a keyword for more information about sentiment or favorability.
- Select a keyword to view all related comments.

## Topics section (or Topics cloud)
Topics are a high-level summary of comments that generate deeper insight. This section may be viewed as a forced, directed view (cloud view) or a table view. Use this key:
- The color of a topic bubble indicates the aggregated sentiment or favorability of related comments.
	- Blue = positive
	- Grey = neutral
	- Red = negative
- The gray lines connecting bubbles indicate related topics. The thicker the line, the stronger the relationship.
- The *size* of a topic bubble reflects the volume of related comments.
- Hover over a topic bubble for more information about sentiment or favorability.
- Select the topic bubble to reveal a slider window with all related comments. 

## Comments section
In this section, you can view all comments or see them by category. The total number of comments appears in the blue box at the top and comments by category, underneath.

### Redacting and Quarantining comments
You may redact terms - flagged as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or as profanity:
- Select **Redact All Terms** to replace all PII and profanity with five-pound signs (#####).
- Select **Un-Redact All** to replace ##### with the original comments.
- Use the **vertical ellipses** next to an individual comment to select **Redact** or **Un-Redact**.

### Learn the importance of quarantining comments when necessary. 
Sensitive comments can be quarantined by using the **vertical ellipses** next to the comment. 
By selecting **Quarantine**, the comment is now only visible to admins with 'Manage Sensitive Comments' capability. Similarly, comments may be un-quarantined.

>[!NOTE]
> Managers with multinational teams can export and read all comments in their preferred languages so that they can easily dig deeper into the comments offline.  For Comment reports generated in less than ten seconds, the file downloads automatically in-browser. For reports requiring longer than a ten-second generation, the user will receive an email link to download their file when it is ready.

## Choose your benchmark in the Settings window
Selecting this button opens the Report Settings slider. Here you can choose your benchmark.
Choosing the right benchmark data helps users interpret survey results within the context of how others are doing. Glint provides several options for benchmark reporting. Note that your company may have substituted custom terms for the Glint terminology explained below.

Internal Benchmarks:
- **Average Question**: Presents a single, overall score for all questions and respondents within your access. Helpful for users looking for some level of variance in their score.
- **Company**: Displays team scores in comparison to company-wide scores for the same questions. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
- **My Teams**: Compares a team's score to an overall score derived from a user’s data access. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
Select **Done** after customizing.
To save the report, use the **Export** button > **Save As**.

## Add a filter to your Comments report
Selecting **Add a filter** expands the filter panel to allow Advanced Filtering. Advanced Filtering enables you to see how one program impacts another. For example, you can view Engagement results filtered by those who had a good onboarding experience.
You can also add attribute or hierarchy filters available for your program in this expanded panel.
