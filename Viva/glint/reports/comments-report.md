# Use Viva Glint’s Comments report 

The Comments report is your window into Viva Glint's Narrative Intelligence technology, which helps managers interpret comment data by highlighting important topic areas, sentiment analysis, and keywords. 
Reviewing comments allows managers to gain further insights into their results. Comments provide helpful context around scores you're exploring in the rest of the application. When a comment count is present, select it to view the comments and interact with Viva Glint’s full Narrative Intelligence experience. Comments can be viewed by demographic and/or survey item. 

## Access the Comments report

The Comments report, for those with comments permission, is accessed from the Viva Glint dashboard > **Reports** > **Comments**.

## Choose which comment sections to view on your dashboard

The Comments report is divided into sections; the Overview section displays on the screen by default.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/comments-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Comments Overview default sections."

- **Comments** - Total number of comments, defined by number of commenters and percentage of respondents.
- **Continent Sentiment** - A bar graph indicating overall positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Topics** - Topics mentioned most often appear here, including the number of mentions.

## Add additional sections to your comments report
There are two ways to add additional sections:
- Select the **+ Add section** button, or
- Use the **More** dropdown menu and then choose **+ Add Section**

Select sections by scrolling through the tabs in the slider window. Add or delete sections at any time. 
- Select the **+ button** to add the section.
- If a **right-facing arrow** displays, choose that to open the window which allows you to filter by attributes. Then select **Add**.

## Questions section
This section can be viewed in grid or table view and includes:
- Top questions by volume
- Top questions by positive sentiment
- Top questions by negative sentiment

## Keywords section
This section can also be viewed in keyword or table view. Keywords are words and phrases that occur most frequently across comments. 
- The color of each keyword indicates the aggregated sentiment or favorability of related comments.
	- Blue = positive
	- Grey = neutral
	- Red = negative
- The *size* of a keyword reflects the volume of related comments.
- Hover over a keyword for more information about sentiment or favorability.
- Select a keyword to view all related comments.

## Topics section (or Topics cloud)
Topics are a high-level summary of comments that generate deeper insight. This section may be viewed as a forced, directed view (cloud view) or a table view. Use this key:
- The color of a topic bubble indicates the aggregated sentiment or favorability of related comments.
	- Blue = positive
	- Grey = neutral
	- Red = negative
- The gray lines connecting bubbles indicate related topics. The thicker the line, the stronger the relationship.
- The *size* of a topic bubble reflects the volume of related comments.
- Hover over a topic bubble for more information about sentiment or favorability.
- Select the topic bubble to reveal a slider window with all related comments. 

## Comments section
In this section, you can view all comments or see them by category. The total number of comments shows in the box at the top and comments by category, underneath.

### Prescriptive and representative comments

Viva Glint suggests using both prescriptive and representative comments when reviewing your Comments report.

#### Prescriptive comments

Prescriptive comments are those, identified by narrative intelligence, that offer specific actionable suggestions for improvement in a focus area. You can access deep, qualitative insights from alerts, goals, or any other report from Narrative Intelligence, which is easily accessible from many places in the platform. Continuous listening as part of ongoing conversations, and jointly developing goals with employees, leads to identifying the most appropriate actions to result in improvements in the workplace experience and the success of your business.

#### Representative comments

Comments that represent overall themes are isolated and shown together. You'll only need to read a few to get a sense of the whole.

### Redacting and quarantining comments

You may redact terms - flagged as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or as profanity:
- Select **Redact All Terms** to replace all PII and profanity with five-pound signs (#####).
- Select **Un-Redact All** to replace ##### with the original comments.
- Use the **vertical ellipses** next to an individual comment to select **Redact** or **Un-Redact**.

### Learn the importance of quarantining comments when necessary. 
Sensitive comments can be quarantined by using the **ellipses** next to the comment. 
By selecting **Quarantine**, the comment is now visible only to admins with *Manage Sensitive Comments* capability. Comments may be un-quarantined.

## Export, save, or share from the Comments report

Selecting this dropdown menu allows you to perform any of these functions:

- Export report to PowerPoint
- Export report to PDF
- Export report to spreadsheet
- Export report to Images
- Export Comments to XLSX Spreadsheet
- Save
- Save As - Rename a customized report and indicate if it should automatically update with the most current data.
- Share

>[!NOTE]
> Managers with multinational teams can export and read all comments in their preferred languages offline, to easily dig deeper into the comments. For Comment reports generated in less than ten seconds, the file downloads automatically in your browser. Reports that require longer than a ten-second generation, generate an email link to the user to download their file when it's ready.

## Choose your benchmark in the Settings window

Selecting this button opens the *Report Settings* slider. Choose your benchmark.
Choosing the right benchmark data helps users interpret survey results within the context of how others are doing. Viva Glint provides several options for benchmark reporting. Note that your company may have substituted custom terms for the Viva Glint terminology explained below.

Internal Benchmarks:
- **Average Question**: Presents a single, overall score for all questions and respondents within your access. Helpful for users looking for some level of variance in their score.
- **Company**: Displays team scores in comparison to company-wide scores for the same questions. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
- **My Teams**: Compares a team's score to an overall score derived from a user’s data access. Helpful for users with more than one area of responsibility.
Select **Done** after customizing.
To save the report, select **Export** and then **Save As**.

## Add a filter to your Comments report
Selecting **Add a filter** expands the filter panel to allow Advanced Filtering. Advanced Filtering enables you to see how one program impacts another. For example, you can view Engagement results filtered by those who had a good onboarding experience. You can also add attribute or hierarchy filters available for your program in this expanded panel.
