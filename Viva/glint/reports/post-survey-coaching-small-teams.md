# Post-survey coaching for managers of small teams interpreting survey results

Survey results in the Microsoft Viva Glint platform are available to managers as soon as one day after the survey closes [Read about Live versus Phased access](/../../viva/glint/setup/live-versus-phased-access). Hopefully your managers are eager to see their results, as are their employees. However, due to confidentiality thresholds set in the Viva Glint platform, some views of feedback results may not display data. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint admin sets the confidentiality threshold in the Reporting section of General Settings. [Read about setting up the Reporting section](/../../viva/glint/setup/manage-general-settings).

Managers who cannot view some or all of their team's data can still have great feedback sessions with their teams. Here's how: 

## Enable Broader Team Insights for your managers 

Managers of small teams may not have *enough team members overall* or *response rate size* to view their own team’s survey responses. Viva Glint considers this number to be a team of five or less respondents. While it's critical to protect survey respondents’ confidentiality, it's also critical to empower small team managers with feedback and action-taking capabilities. Broader Team Insights (BTI) helps to bridge that gap.

[Follow this guidance to enable Broader Team Insights for your managers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2231012)

## BTI allows managers with fewer than five respondents to hold feedback conversations 

> [!TIP]
> Typically the minimum response threshold in your Viva Glint platform should be set to five (5) or more respondents to protect employee confidentiali

Each team’s data rolls up into the next level, so each team is represented in their direct manager’s report. While your managers should have this summary as part of your ACT Conversation, Viva Glint recommends giving managers access to Broader Team Insights as a starting point for their own ACT Conversation. They will download the presentation kit through the prompt at the top of their Viva Glint dashboard when BTI is enabled. 

Review those results. Use the [Manager Quick Guide to Interpretation](https://adoption.microsoft.com/files/viva/glint/Microsoft-Viva-Glint-manager-quick-guide.pdf) to prepare for your conversation.

Managers of small teams can hold their ACT Conversation to discuss where the larger-group results do and don't reflect their smaller-group experience and what action the team will commit to in order to facilitate improvements. 

## Managers can fall short of the respondent requirements for a number of reasons

- **Some leaders might have enough respondents in their overall hierarchy to generate a report, but not enough respondents who report into them directly** 

> For example, a leader who has four (4) direct reports, and then each of those directs have six (6) direct reports - Let’s say this leader had 100% participation across their larger team. 
    With 28 responses, they'll receive a report but will not be able to filter that report to only see their four (4) direct reports’ responses, since there are less than 5.

- **A manager may have a team of more than five (5) employees but not all of them might answer the survey or all of the survey items**

> For example, perhaps the team has 14 employees. If only four (4) of those employees answer the survey **or** only four (4) respond to a certain item, no data will be shown.

In these cases, the leader should still have an ACT Conversation with their direct reports using roll-up (BTI) results. Throughout the Acknowledge part of an ACT conversation, the manager should talk to the team about which results might be pertinent to their smaller team or smaller group of respondents.

## Conversations are meaningful even if they do not refer directly to a manager's own team results

The goal of survey feedback is to understand what most engages and inspires a team to be their best at work. Survey scores are a starting point for a conversation that involves a team in identifying actions that can be taken to improve engagement. Even just a few responses - or limited views of results - can make effective use of available BTI data and foster a rich team conversation. 

## Small teams may seem less likely to need survey results but this theory is incorrect

Managers of small teams may sometimes feel survey results do not provide much value, especially if they easily and regularly connect with their team members to know how everyone is doing. While there is truth in this, when teams do not earn enough responses to view their own results, Broader Team Insights (BTI) can be very helpful in giving a sense for how the larger org is doing - including other voices and feedback.
 
> [!NOTE]
> If a small team does earn enough responses to view their own data, be mindful that there can be large score swings purely based on one person coming into or leaving the team. These changes may seem intimidating but are not necessarily indicative of actual sentiment changes. Having a specific survey-specific conversation with a small team is essential to ensuring a true understanding of the team’s engagement and the bigger, organizational picture.
