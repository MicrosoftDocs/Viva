# Interpret the Keyword Cloud 
Viva Glint’s Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology extracts keywords and phrases that are relevant, commonly occurring, and unique to a filtered population. The keyword cloud is a section available on the Comments report.
- **Relevance** is defined by how much more frequently a keyword appears than the naturally expected occurrence in organizational surveys. 
- The **size** of the word in the keyword cloud is based on the relevancy of the term. 
- **Color** represents the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). 
 
## Generation of the keyword cloud
A minimum number of comments is required in order for the keyword cloud to be generated by a report. There also needs to be a minimum number of occurrences for the keyword to appear, and the word needs to be in Viva Glint’s proprietary dictionary. The keyword cloud will always be in English, but NLP will translate the comments left into other languages. 
 
## Understand the keyword cloud methodology
Viva Glint’s keyword methodology requires that keywords are:
- **Inherently meaningful** within the context of employee engagement
- **Relevant** within the context of a survey’s results
- **Unique** compared to other companies’ survey  
 
The following steps explain how and why keywords are considered for inclusion in a keyword cloud.  

### Isolating Keywords
The first step to building a keyword cloud is to identify if a word actually qualifies as a keyword. To do so, Viva Glint's Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology defines keywords, excludes stop words, and analyzes word sequence.
 
#### Defining Keywords
Viva Glint has a proprietary dictionary with over 16,000 keywords that are commonly associated with employee engagement. For this reason alone, even some of a survey’s most commonly used words may not be included in a keyword cloud.  
Viva Glint’s dictionary is continually updated through a combination of machine learning and human touch. Survey comments are matched against the dictionary in order to isolate keywords that should be considered for keyword cloud inclusion. 

#### Excluding Stop Words
By its very definition, a keyword must be significant. For example, words like “the” or “to” have little inherent meaning and are considered “stop words.” These are excluded from Glint’s dictionary. In turn, any comments analysis will account only for meaningful words like “satisfied” or “leadership.”

#### Analyzing Word Sequence
Technically, a keyword can be a single word (e.g. “priorities”) or a word string, like “career development.” In order to isolate a single or multi-word keyword, each survey comment is split into various sequences. As an example, let’s look at this comment: “I am happy and have work life balance.” 
- One-word sequence: I, am, happy, and, have, work, life, balance, …
- Two-word sequence: I am, am happy, happy and, and have, …
- Three-word sequence: ...and have work, have work life, work life balance.
Each sequence is then matched against Viva Glint’s keyword dictionary. **In this example, the keywords “happy” and “work life balance” are defined as keywords**.  
 
### Scoring Keywords 
Once a keyword is isolated, Viva Glint assigns it a score based on its relevance and salience (i.e. usefulness). 
- To calculate **relevance**, the scoring algorithm determines a keyword’s frequency within a slice. A slice is a cut of data, such as the results of a company-wide survey or the results of a filtered group within a survey. A higher frequency of the keyword within a slice indicates higher relevance, which increases its score.
- To identify salience, a keyword is featured only if it is unique compared to other slices or surveys. The scoring algorithm also determines a keyword’s frequency within all comments on Viva Glint across all companies. Here, a higher frequency of the keyword indicates lower salience, which decreases its score. 
 Keywords with the highest scores go through a final sorting process to determine which are ultimately featured in a keyword cloud.   
 
### Sorting Keywords
In order to properly represent a survey’s results, the keyword cloud should also represent as many of a survey’s comments as possible. A balance must also exist between representing keywords from all comments and keywords which are still the most meaningful. 

For example, certain keywords (management, communication, feedback, etc…) typically have a high frequency across comments in every slice and across all companies. Keyword clouds could easily look the same in almost any scenario, which isn’t helpful. 

To sort keywords effectively, Viva Glint uses an optimal range of times that a keyword is represented in a slice’s comments in order to be included in the keyword cloud. This is referred to as **slice coverage**.  Optimal slice coverage range does not include keywords with the highest frequency; the purpose is to include commonly occurring high-scoring keywords and not those that aren’t so frequent that they lose their unique value. 

Viva Glint puts a slice’s keywords through a final sorting process where:
1.	The highest-scoring keyword is pulled forward for consideration. If it falls within the most optimal slice coverage range, it is added to the keyword cloud. 
1.	The comment with the next highest-scoring keyword is then compared to the optimal slice coverage range. And so on…
1.	Since not all keywords will match the first optimal slice coverage range, Viva Glint matches keywords from the remaining comments against the next most optimal slice coverage range. 

This sorting process is repeated until a target number of keywords for inclusion in the keyword cloud is reached.  
Through this process of isolating, scoring, and sorting, Glint’s keyword clouds contain keywords that are meaningful, commonly occurring, and unique.
