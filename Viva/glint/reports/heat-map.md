# Use the Viva Glint Heat Map Report

The Microsoft Viva Glint Heat Map Report identifies high and low scoring teams on engagement and other key drivers and can be filtered by attributes within your Glint Employee Data File.

The Heat Map Report is useful for HRBPs, admins, or any senior leader who would benefit from looking across multiple groups for comparisons.

## What does the Heat Map Report show?

 >[!NOTE]
> Heat Map results are only available when confidentiality thresholds are met.

Heat maps are sorted so that it’s easy to find patterns. The rows at the top typically tend to have higher scores across the majority of teams, while the columns on the left represent teams with lower scores across the majority of drivers. Heat Maps are interactive and display scores for each question broken down by demographic attributes – (for example: team, location, or tenure). Use Heat maps to quickly and easily spot patterns and outliers.

>[!NOTE]
> Colors indicate high and low scores relative to the median score in the Heat Map.

## Accessing the Heat Map Report

Select the **Reports** tab on your admin dashboard and then the **Heat Map Report** card. The heat map display defaults to show your team.

## Using the Heat Map Report

Select the **Reports** tab on your admin dashboard and then the **Heat Map Report** card. 

The heat map display defaults to show your teams (Manager).

### Color coding 

The colors in the Heat Map allow quick identification of systemic patterns and outliers. Color coding is relative and not absolute. For any population you see, the highest score is in the darkest blue, while the lowest score is in the darkest red. The other scores are plotted in various shades of blues and red relative to the highest and lowest scores. 

- The maximum and minimum are always displayed as dark blue and dark red.
- All scores between the maximum and minimum are evenly bucketed in up to seven different colored buckets, with the median score being shown in the gray middle bucket.
>For example:
> - If the minimum and maximum scores are 69 and 87, then Glint will create 7 evenly spaced buckets between 52 and 80.
> - Dark red would be 69-71
> - Dark blue would be 87-87
> - Gray would be 77-81 with the other shades being in between
> - The other color buckets are evenly spaced between the maximum/minimum values.

Here's an example of that color coding:

## Changing the view of the Heat Map

### Changing the view by score comparisons

The Heat Map defaults to a **Scores view**. You can change your view of the data by selecting the **Settings** button.
In the *Report Settings* windown that opens, use the *Show* dropdown menu to choose from:

- Scores
- Changes
- vs Company
- Scores and Changes
- Scores and vs Company
  
### Changing the view by benchmark

In this same window, you can change your internal benchmark comparison: 
- Company
- My Teams
- Average Question

### Changing the view by adding sections or attributes

Heat Maps can be generated for any of the attributes for which you have permission, like location or department.

Select the **More** button to open dropdown and then choose **Add section**. Within this window you can choose to view survey scores by many score options, by comments, demographic, and more.

## Deep diving into a specific cell

You can select any cell to drill down into that particular key driver within a team. Let's use this example:

> You want to know why Abbi's team has scored low on Work Life Balance.

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/heat-map-cell.png" alt-text="Screenshot of one cell in a team's key driver row.":::

> Hover over the cell to see the comparisons. Here, the score for the Work Life Balance is 72, compared to 78 which is the Company score for this driver.
 
:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/reports/heat-map-comparison.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the comparison scores for a cell.":::

> Now, select the cell to open a report to deep dive into all the information around that driver.

Use the larger report to identify hot spots or low scores, outliers, and bright spots or areas to celebrate.
