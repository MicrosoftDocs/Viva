# Set up Team Conversations coaching for managers

The last survey setup page in Program Summary is the Coaching page. Managers who have Team Conversations enabled benefit from extra guidance made available within the setup of this page.

Program Summary setup occurs at the program level, not at the individual cycle level. The Coaching page appears differently for customers with Team Conversations enabled vs disabled.

- Coaching section: Setup required for all admins
- Team Conversations presentation guidance section: Visible with Team Conversations enabled only
- Team Conversation resource guidance: Visible with Team Conversations enabled only

## Team Conversations presentation guidance

Customize Team Conversation Presentation Guidance to help your managers have successful conversations around survey results.

- Team Conversations must be enabled. Do that in Program Setup
- If your program is already approved, toggle to **NO** so editing can occur. **Save changes**
- The presentation can't be set up after survey results have been released
- Managers will configure the *Pick a Focus Area* and *Choose Action Items* sections with their team. They are unable to make any other changes to the presentation

**The following information applies to each section:**

- The Section Name for each page is used for navigation and can be customized
- Customize content by selecting **Edit** to reveal the slider panel. You may use the default text content provided or customize
- **Preview** at any time
- **Save Changes** after editing each section
- Each translation added will auto-save after another language is selected

### Title

Add your spin to the first slide to welcome the team.

- Section Name - Customize or use the default
- Conversation Title - Fill in the blue macro fields to personalize the slide title

### Introduction

Personalize headings and body content for three conversation points. You must include three conversation points. Use the **+ button** to add any macro fields you want to incorporate.

- Section Name - Customize or use the default
- Slide Heading - Customize or use the default
- Step 1 - Step 3 Header - Customize using the **+ button** or use the default
- Step 1 - Step 3 Body - Customize using the **+ button** or use the default

### Reflection Point

The presentation kit makes two Reflection Point pages available for managers. The first slide is for the team to consider *before* reviewing their results; the second slide is for *after* they have seen results. Both pages can be turned on or off.

- Show Reflection - Switch the button to **ON** or **OFF** to include or exclude the slide
- Section Name - Customize or use the default
- Reflection Text - Use the default text or customize by using the **+ button**

### How We're Doing

- Section Name - Customize or use the default.

*Each of the following slides have prepopulated default text or you can customize the header and thought starter, using macro fields if desired. The presentation must include all the slides provided.*

- Thank You slide
- High-Level Results slide
- Biggest Changes slide
- Relative Strengths slide
- Relative Opportunities slide
- Multiple Choice Questions slide - The preview will show all multiple-choice questions, but the actual manager presentation will only show the questions from the applicable cycle.

### Pick a Focus Area

This section is where each team will collaboratively choose a Focus Area. Detailed guidance for your manager is available to them directly in their presentation kit.

- Section Name - Customize or use the default
- Slide Heading - Customize or use the default
- Subtext - Use the default text or customize by using the **+ button**

### Choose Action Items

The team will work together to identify action items to improve Focus Areas.

- Section Name - Customize or use the default
- Slide Heading - Customize or use the default
- Subtext - Use the default text or customize by using the **+ button**.
- Button Text - Use the default or customize what the manager will use in their presentation.

### Summary Page

The summary shown changes depending on whether the manager has marked the conversation as completed.

- Section Name - Customize or use the default
- Before Conversation is marked Done
  - Slide Heading - Customize or use the default
  - Subtext - Use the default text or customize by using the **+ button.**
- After Conversation is marked Done
  - Slide Heading - Customize or use the default.
  - Subtext - Use the default text or customize by using the **+ button.**

## Add resources to the Team Conversations kit

Enable or disable guidance by switching to **ON** or **OFF**. Enabling Guidance allows you to select a Content Resource from the dropdown menu. Guidance is specific to the process of conversations and doesn't correlate with the specific Focus Area a manager and their team choose.

>[!NOTE]
> View Content Resources already suggested in this kit by navigating from your dashboard to Content Resources and you may add your own resources here as well. All suggested Content Resources and added resources appear in the dropdown menu and can be added to the presentation kit.*

At any time, or once this page is entirely set up, select **Preview** to see the managers' view. The presentation includes:

- Slide names (on the left) for navigation
- A personal note to the manager
- Best Practices & Tips (resources) you have selected.

Select **Get Started** to begin the presentation.

Select **Read More** in Best Practices & Tips to ensure that you have chosen the resource that will best assist your managers. Edit your presentation, as necessary.
