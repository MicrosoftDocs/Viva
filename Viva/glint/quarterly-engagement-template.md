# Quarterly Engagement survey template

Microsoft Viva Glint has seen a shift in focus on what is most important to the happiness and success of employees since mid-2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global factors. For this reason, we knew we needed to reexamine our current measures of employee engagement (2018) to ensure we're focusing on the most meaningful engagement drivers for this modern era. 

We analyzed over 350 million employee survey responses collected since 2020 to determine the employee experiences that were most predictive of engagement - happiness at work and willingness to recommend the company. We discovered some new key driver themes, which resulted in a new top-20 list of core engagement drivers. Additionally, we identified several other drivers that may be beneficial for consideration by individual organizations. 

**Read [People Science Explains: People Success Elements - What people need in the new world of work to understand Glint’s unique approach to help organizations measure employee engagement](https://www.glintinc.com/blog/the-elements-of-people-success/).** Using Viva Glint solutions, our customers gain powerful insights on what drives their employee engagement and can use the insights to build towards their own People Success culture.

## Details of Quarterly Engagement template

The result of our re-examination of the focus of engagement is a modernized framework (early 2022) called **People Success Elements. These elements are six constructs**. Purpose, Clarity, Growth, Empowerment, Connection, and Wellbeing summarizes the fundamental needs and expectations that are most critical to a person’s holistic life experience (not only their work experience) and that best shape an environment for high engagement.

### People Success Elements

In addition to evidence of a strong linkage between the following six elements and engagement, People Science also found relationships with other important outcomes like burnout and intent to stay. Key findings in each construct include:

- **Purpose**: Employees feeling a sense of purpose are 120% more likely to recommend their company as a great place to work.
- **Clarity**: 54% of employees lacking role clarity reported burnout in 2021, compared with 38% of employees with role clarity.
- **Growth**: Employees who see opportunities to grow are three times more likely to say they'll remain with the company in two years.
- **Empowerment**: Employees empowered at work are 2.4 times more likely to be happy at work.
- **Connection**: Employees with a strong sense of belonging are six times more likely to be engaged.
- **Wellbeing**: Employees who feel cared for at work are over three times as likely to be happy at work and recommend working for their organization, an increase of over 35% since 2020. Flexible work arrangements, inclusive workplaces, and work-life balance are the fastest growing priorities for job candidates since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

### Terminology of survey items

The following terminology helps you to understand our methodology for determining survey items:

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|:---|:---|
| **Core Drivers (also referred to as Recommended Drivers)** | Items hand-picked by Viva Glint People Science for customer use are included on templates. These items are the strongest predictors of the outcome item(s) in a survey program. We recommend customers to consider these items first when building a survey and to consider them as the best practice “short list.”  |
| **Other Drivers** | Most Viva Glint programs have “other” drivers, too - items that are strong drivers of engagement that we want customers to be aware of but aren't part of the core/recommended driver selection for that program. |
| **Key Drivers** | These items have the highest impact on program *outcome*. They're statistically calculated based on feedback, thus likely to change. |
| **Outcome** | The purpose of your survey; what you are trying to measure. Viva Glint uses surveys to measure engagement (the *outcome*) and calculates the impact of survey items (*drivers*) and how much they influence engagement. Work on the top items (*key drivers*) for the most efficient use of feedback - the most bang for your buck! |
