# Delete survey data from Viva Glint

As your company’s data controller, Microsoft Viva Glint admins can delete non-active surveys data. This action deletes every data entity directly related to the survey, including overall survey configuration, items/questions, reports, responses, etc.
The action won’t delete distribution lists or any roles related with the survey. 

> [!NOTE]
> Viva Glint admins must have Advanced Configuration access enabled to delete survey data.

> [!CAUTION]
> Survey data deletion in Viva Glint is an irreversible process. Perform this action only when confident that the data of the survey is not required anymore. 

## Survey data can be deleted from Surveys Programs on the admin configuration dashboard 
To delete survey data from Viva Glint, follow this process:
1.	Select **Survey Programs** from your admin **Configuration** page. 
1.	Use the search box or navigate over the **Survey Programs** list to identify the survey that data should be deleted from. 
1.	Hovering over the identified survey, select the three dots on the right and from the dropdown menu, choose **Delete**.
1.	A **Survey Delete** confirmation box will ask for confirmation and display the following message: “This will permanently delete all data associated with this program.”
1.	If you are not sure if they should complete the action, then select **No, I am not sure**, otherwise **confirm the action**. 
1.	Once the delete action has been completed, return to the Survey page to verify that the survey does not appear in the Survey Programs list.
