# Viva People Science Patient Safety Culture Survey development methodology

The methodology used to develop the Viva Glint Patient Safety Survey followed these steps:

- Exploratory interviews with external patient safety experts/practitioners were conducted.
- A thorough literature review on the culture of patient safety which included over 90 articles and 15-20 patient safety culture survey instruments. All Leapfrog-approved instruments were studied extensively.
- Development of a 295-item taxonomy with 48 different patient safety domains.
- The list was culled down to 80 items and 18 domains for scientific testing. Items were evaluated for clarity and simplicity; items assessing the same or very similar constructs were removed.
- Viva Glint researchers developed several theoretical models of patient safety culture for scientific testing based on literature findings.
- A random sample of over 1,300 full-time healthcare professionals in the U.S., consistent with Leapfrog’s guidance, received the items. AHRQ items and actual patient safety outcomes (e.g., Leapfrog grade, HCAHPS patient satisfaction data, Hospital-acquired infections, Post-surgical infections) were included in the item set for validation purposes.
- Statistical testing and additional feedback provided validity and reliability information to choose the best performing items for the final instrument. These tests and processes included:
  - Factor analysis (single factor, EFA, CFA)
  - Reliability analysis (alpha)
  - Alpha-if-item-Deleted
  - Correlations
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
  - Standard deviation
  - Correlations to established or validated culture of patient safety items (i.e., AHRQ)
  - Correlation to overall Culture of Patient Safety outcome - a two-item outcome measure was developed after careful testing. The extent to which other items correlated to this outcome was a factor in selecting the item or not.
  - Inter-item correlations
  - Correlations to publicly reported external patient safety outcome measures like HCAHPS, Leapfrog grades, and Infections
  - Relative weights analysis
  - Proportion of variance explained in the facet
  - Survey review by our expert team
  - Final review by five external patient safety experts

After thorough testing, single-marker items were chosen for various safety topics such as Just culture, Psychological safety, Communication, Teamwork, Across-department communication, and Leadership commitment to safety. Top performing items were identified and additional testing was done on these final 16 items. A 62-page technical report was assembled and sent to Leapfrog’s expert panel for validation.

**Viva Glint received Leapfrog approval in June of 2020.**
