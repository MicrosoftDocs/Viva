# Propel Action-taking through conversations - Viva People Science

The likelihood of employee feedback fueling organizational success hinges on the actions taken based on that feedback. Many companies build excitement and energy around taking the survey: "We want to hear from you!" and "Thank you for the feedback!". However, the momentum often slows somewhere between "Here’s what we’re going to do about your feedback!" and what actually gets done to address issues and make positive incremental changes.

## Compelling data points reveal why action taking is critical 

- People who don't believe action is taken are 7x more likely to
be disengaged than people who do believe action is taken.

- Teams where the manager uses action planning in the Glint
platform show a 7% increase in scores on average.

- Teams that score high on action planning are more likely to say that they have confidence in the leadership team. They are more likely to be  excited about the future prospects of the company.

- A single quarter is enough time to see increases in scores across varying teams when action is taken.

- Regardless of the area on which action is taken, there is a high likelihood that confidence in leadership increases, and this sentiment has an indirect effect on engagement & performance.

## Why isn't action-taking working today?

### Ownership of action is unclear

Everyone agrees that acting on feedback is important. However, often it’s unclear who is responsible for action taking or the
necessary actions are unequally distributed. 

In some organizations, taking action on engagement results is seen as HR’s responsibility. Glint data shows that employees typically expect
HR and leadership to own the actions that result from survey results. That result isn't unexpected as in many organizations, front-line managers don’t
receive results for their teams. If they do receive results, they receive them weeks or months later. This is often viewed as a good practice because it gives each level ofleadership time to synthesize results and prepare responses. **Inadvertently, it signals to managers that engagement data is not theirs to own and improve.**

**As a result, managers often shift the responsibility of acting and communicating actions to leadership and HR**. This may cause HR teams to feel responsible for addressing all feedback and that feeling is overwhelming for already stretched teams. 

And importantly, limited interaction between senior leadership and employees means that employees have less visibility into the actions being taken.

Even in organizations where ownership is shifted to
front-line managers, challenges exist. Managers often believe that
they bear the entire responsibility of action-taking and must
respond to every opportunity surfaced in the results. This gives managers hours of work spent combing through results and countless problems to fix. Instead of feeling empowered, they feel deflated.

### Support and enablement are limited

Managers play a critical role in fostering engagement and learning
within an organization, but many lack the tools and support needed to
contribute effectively to team performance and development. First-time
managers on the front-line manage nearly as much as two-thirds of the
workforce. Over half of these managers don’t get adequate training.

### Complex action plans are unsustainable

Many action-taking processes overthink on the planning instead of the execution.
Creators of the Agile Manifesto know that it’s more important to respond to change than follow a plan.
When 80% of action-taking effort is focused on developing long, detailed
action plans, the process feels cumbersome. Cumbersome processes are easy to de-
prioritize them when other business needs arise. This sentiment is especially true when
surveys only occur once per year or every other year. When managers
feel they have 12 or more months to make improvements, they’re more
likely to overplan and overcommit. And it’s likely they lose
momentum before they actually start to take sustainable action!
Bottom line, lengthy action plans, built into
a silo can take months to act upon. Unless people are enabled to
build good, simple habits around sustainable action taking, it’s likely
to run out of steam.

### Feedback can feel hard to act on

Whether giving or receiving feedback, people shy away from being
direct because it feels uncomfortable, especially on teams that might
lack [psychological safety](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2274114). Feedback, which is
perceived as negative doesn’t always result in improvement because
most people want to avoid it. Feedback may feel like a personal attack
when managers see it as a reflection of their abilities. Some assume it’s their responsibility to fix all the issues while
others may feel like the issues are not under their control and defer the
responsibility. Rather than feeling empowered to make change happen
with their teams, they end up feeling deflated or helpless.

## Use an agile approach to taking action

In order for actions on feedback to be effective, they must become
part of the flow of how we work. This action is called “an agile approach”
to engagement. There are three key components to making engagement (or
any HR program) evolve to meet the changing needs of today’s world:

- **People** who have the right mindset, skills, and behaviors to support the
shift.
- **Technology** that puts the right information at people’s fingertips
with in a simple and delightful way.
- **Strategy** that aligns with the priorities and flow of work in a business.

Let’s unpack each of these components:

### People

It starts with awareness and education about the role everyone plays in
making your organization a great place to work. Show that everyone can
participate in productive conversations about survey results and feel
ownership over action. Start by releasing results to
all managers as quickly as possible. It’s critical that all managers are part
of this process so it feels transparent and inclusive. Outline clear
expectations for everyone, define straightforward steps, and equip your HR teams to coach managers and leaders to model the
right behaviors. No one person should be responsible for creating an engaged and high-performing workplace.

### Technology

The Glint platform was designed to put meaningful insights into the
hands of managers so teams can move to action. This process starts with an
intuitive interface that surfaces key insights based on modern OD
science. Viva Glint makes it easy to identify focus areas and provide guidance on what to do about it through:

- Strengths & Opportunities: A simple and highly actionable summary of what a manager does well and their growth opportunities.

- Narrative Intelligence: An award-winning natural language processing (NLP) engine that surfaces key themes and associated
sentiment from comment data so you can better understand employee feedback.

- Action items: Curated recommendations for actions that can be taken as well as an extensive resource library for how to improve in
any specific focus area.

- Manager Concierge: An in-platform coach that provides step-by-step guidance. The guidance should take into account the actions a manager has
taken and make intelligent recommendations for actions to take next to help their teams be more successful.

### Strategy

You need a sustainable and simple strategy to move from one-way
listening to effective action in an organization centered around the
right habits. Rethink how you invest your time. Instead
of improving your listening strategy, shift your focus and develop a
conversation strategy. Help your organization make quality feedback
conversations a habit. Quality conversations help managers and teams use data
to fuel action and change behaviors. Here are some key elements of a simple, agile strategy for taking action:

- **Share feedback more frequently.** Timely, relevant data informs
important business decisions and priorities and allows managers to
build habits through repetition. If people only get feedback once per
year, they have to learn interpretation and conversation skills all over
again every 12+ months.

- **Reduce the time between feedback and action.** Get out the data 
as soon as possible in the hands of teams so they can get started
working on it.

- **Have a laser focus on one impactful shift at a time.** Don’t focus your
team’s energy on creating long action plans.

- **Make adjustments and learn together.** Evaluate what’s working and
what’s not. Course correct along the way.

- **Create a simple check-in process.** Help teams collaborate and
hold each other accountable. This process can be a 30-minute check-in
from initial results and then 10 minutes on your monthly
weekly team meeting agenda to keep it alive. The key is not only to
discuss action when the survey results come out.

## Understand that conversations matter

Even the best-laid action taking efforts often lose momentum a few
weeks after survey results are released. After the initial fervor that comes
with new information, other priorities take over. It’s not
uncommon for robust action plans to see little progress because there
is no simple mechanism to hold teams accountable for progress. The
missing ingredient to creating sustainable focus on taking action on
feedback is obvious and often overlooked: **Conversations.**

:::image type="content" source="../../media/glint/setup/conversations-matter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the five reasons that conversations matter.":::

### Why do conversations matter?

Research shows that checking in and having conversations in
the workplace are critical to productivity and well-being. Unfortunately few
organizations fully grasp the art of having conversations that are
meaningful and propel progress.

### What is the problem with conversations?

People have lots of reasons for avoiding important conversations. It’s not always clear how to facilitate a good conversation and therefore the value is unclear. Conversations about feedback can feel awkward or intimidating.

## The reason Viva People Science developed the ACT Conversation. 

The ACT Conversation Guide serves as a simple framework for having productive conversations that foster
meaningful connection and continuous improvement. The conversation framework allows managers and teams to practice the critical steps of a quality feedback conversation and make it a habit.

## Why ACT works

The ACT conversation guide is built on a combination of behavioral science
and practical expertise on what fuels change within organizations.

- **C**ollaborate
- **T**ake one step forward

## Summary

Having meaningful conversations that drive connection and focus is hard. ACT conversations require skill. By providing a simple framework focused on repeating the right habits, skills are learned. Once managers understand feedback and connection, conversations become habits, which propel action and continuous improvement. And these habits won't be dependent on HR. When this culture embeds itself into an organization, people feel heard and valued, and they can thrive.
