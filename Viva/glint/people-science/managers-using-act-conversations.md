# How managers can use Viva Glint ACT Conversations

Research shows that having conversations in the workplace are critical to productivity and well-being. But there are lots of reasons for avoiding important conversations:
- It’s not always clear how to facilitate a good conversation.
- The value is unclear.
- Conversations about feedback can feel awkward or intimidating.

This is the reason Viva People Science developed the ACT Conversation Guide. ACT conversations serve as a simple framework for having productive conversations to foster meaningful connection and continuous improvement. The conversation framework allows managers and teams to practice the steps of a quality feedback conversation and make them a habit.

## [Manager Quick Guide to Results and Conversations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2270009)
Share this guide with your managaers to help them navigate the Glint platform and interpret and use survey results. ACT conversations build quality managers who lead engaged teams.

## Why ACT works

The ACT conversation guide is built on a combination of behavioral science and practical expertise on what fuels change within organizations.

- **A**cknowledge
- **C**ollaborate
- **T**ake one step forward

## ACT conversations create trust 

By openly sharing and discussing feedback, trust improves on teams. ACT requires that managers bring their survey data to the team meeting for open discussion, rather than deciding what the problem and solution are on their own. 
 - Conversations prompts encourage the manager to bring the data to the team and work together to identify impactful focus area.
 - Prompts are written with the intention of maximizing [psychological safety](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=227411). People often avoid having difficult conversations. Avoidance leads to counterproductive behaviors like complaining to others, doing unnecessary work, or getting angry. 

## What is the manager's role in ACT conversations?

Driving engagement and performance is a team sport. Leadership has a role to play in influencing key drivers, such as decision-making, collaboration, prospects, and purpose. When feedback results show up as org-wide focus areas, it becomes clear that senior leadership intends to own some of the actions.

**Managers are close to the experience and create accountability.** They can craft solutions to enhance what matters most to their people and use existing processes to drive progress. Managers can use survey feedback to build closer connections within their teams and increase participation to make things better. 

The role of the manager in the feedback process is not to fix engagement problems but to own ongoing conversations about taking action which fuel progress.

Managers play the role of:

- **Coach**: Managers must show confidence in the team’s ability and willingness to solve problems. They should provide direction to keep the team on track and avoid going too broad or too deep. They should act as a role model. If employees see managers displaying candor, vulnerability, accountability, and focus, they are likely to follow suit. 

- **Facilitator**: As a facilitator, managers help teams collaborate on an outcome. Managers provide guidelines based on their knowledge of the organization and then seek out team opinions to ensure all voices are heard.

- **Roadblock Remover**: Taking action can be tough due to organizational constraints. Managers are the first-line of escalation to help overcome roadblocks and often must navigate larger organizational structures to help their teams drive change.

- **Connector**: The most important role of the manager is to have ongoing, meaningful conversations with their team that align with priorities. Managers can check in frequently through team meetings or one-on-ones to ensure improvements are being made, then course correct as needed. Managers also connect with other groups that may be working on similar challenges.

## Make ACTs work for your organization

- The first step to building or changing a habit is wanting to change the habit. At Glint, we talk about feeling accountable versus holding people accountable. When managers feel accountable for improving engagement, they are likely to invest in building good habits around action taking. 

- Integrate ACT into ongoing processes such as performance management conversations, stand-up meetings, business reviews, staff meetings, etc. Don’t add more meetings!

- Tell stories. Reliance on action plans and tracking often comes from a desire to demonstrate progress to executives and other stakeholders. Instead, focus on impact. A "check-the-box" mentality drives superficial change. Building the right habits for effective conversations results in sustainable improvements. Use stories to talk about how feedback and conversations has helped your business. Stories show greater impact than statistics.
  - Did a manager use the results to improve collaboration and deliver a product on-time?
  - Did an executive use employee input as a compass to navigate major organizational change? 

- Embed ACT principles. Bite-sized feedback, dialogue, collaboration between managers and teams, and quick, targeted actions feed progress. 

- ACT conversations help employees appreciate each other. **Acknowledge,** tips encourage sharing stories of positive progress. Focus on the positive, in addition to what needs to improve.

## Are ACT conversations just one more thing to do?

No! Leaders and managers are already too busy. Creating more work is a recipe for failure. Acting on survey feedback should be integrated into the “way we do things around here."

### Should action planning be a separate meeting?

Creating more meetings is not the answer. Make focus areas part of your regular team meetings. Check-ins don’t have to be long. 
When taking action on feedback feels separate from your business priorities, it likely feels burdensome. By putting feedback in the context of strategic objectives, working on something new and working effectively becomes a priority.

## ACT conversations drive focus

Focus is critical to effectiveness. Unfortunately, we often forget to prioritize how to take action on feedback. It’s not uncommon to become overwhelmed by the number of issues that arise in survey feedback and overcommit. The result is that organizational energy and resources are often diluted and nothing changes.

### If we asked a question in a survey, do we have a responsibility to address it?

No. Employees understand that everyone is busy and that resources are limited. As long as they play a part in prioritizing and they see progress, they know their feedback is valued. Additionally, most items in Glint surveys are statistically correlated. This means improving on one item, likely improves other items. **Collaborate** prompts focus on solving one item. **Take one step forward** is intentional to keep commitments manageable.

## Get to the root of behaviors 

It’s common for eager teams to tackle a problem by creating a new solution to address it. With the right intentions, we add new things to do without taking anything away. **Often, change requires as much undoing as doing**. Discuss what behaviors are needed to start, stop, and continue. 

## Identify individual commitment

Social theory shows that when you believe responsibility is diffused, you're less likely to make an effort to solve it. If you believe improving morale and engagement is someone else’s problem, it’s unlikely you're motivated to help. While managers have a clear role to play, each member on the team influences the outcome of progress. 

## Foster an environment of ongoing learning

Focusing less on achieving a goal and more on ongoing learning creates a growth mindset.
- **Acknowledge** conversations nudge the team to share what’s working and what’s not.
- During the **Collaborate** phase, encourage deconstructing what we need to start, stop, and continue doing to improve outcomes. - In the **Take one step forward** phase, teams commit to when they check in again, signaling an initial chat isn't the end of the conversation.

## Create an agile, continuous improvement mindset

Do you believe engagement can be fixed with a silver bullet solution? Research shows that organizations that have an agile approach to people success are more likely to see business success. At the heart of an agile approach is that we can’t always get it right the first time. We must continuously learn from mistakes and iterate. Rather than over-focus on developing a detailed plan, the ACT conversation guide prompts teams to commit to one simple change over the course of a few weeks, share lessons learned, and repeat the process.

### Shift

Shifting doesn’t require monumental change. It’s the alteration of a simple behavior that can be easily made. Examples of shifts from an ACT Conversation:

- Recognition focus: start regular meetings with each team member and recognize someone else on the team for their support.
- Empowerment focus: the manager invites the team to come up with the top three things they want to delegate and commit to at the next team meeting.
- Risk-taking focus: at the end of each week, the manager sends a note, asking team members to respond if they tried something different this week and share how it went.
- Downward communication focus: the manager sends team three bullet points after each leadership meeting with key points for people to know.

## Summary

Having meaningful conversations which drive connection and focus is hard. ACT conversations require skill. By providing a simple framework focused on repeating the right habits, skills are learned. Conversations become habits that propel action and continuous improvement, and these habits aren't dependent on HR. When an ACT culture embeds itself into an organization, people feel heard and valued, and they can truly thrive.
