# Consider People Science factors for historical imports

For highly trained users, Microsoft Viva Glint Advanced Configuration offers the ability to import external, historical response data for items that trend with items that you select for your Viva Glint survey program. Trend data is important. It's essential to look at changes over time. However, there are several strategic factors to consider before you review the technical criteria of historical imports.

## When did you conduct your last survey?

How recent is your data? To determine what “recent” means for your organization, consider: Has your business gone through significant change (strategy shift, external market or economic changes, organizational restructure, significant growth or reduction of your employee base)? If any of these changes have occurred, you may want to think twice about historical data as your comparisons may not be meaningful. Generally, it isn't advisable to import data that is more than one year old.

## How does your previous response scale compare to Viva Glint’s?

Glint’s response scale is a 1 to 5 Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. If your previous items don't use this exact scale, it’s difficult to map items to make meaningful comparisons.

## Do your items map to Viva Glint items?

As you review the core items of the Glint taxonomy, do these items map to your previous items? It's important to consider intent of the question and the referent. If the items don't align to the Glint items, the comparisons aren't relevant.

## Will external, historical data further your engagement strategy?

There are complexities when bringing over historical data. Between different vendors, there are intricacies between outcome measures, scales, and question wording. Bringing in previous items doesn't often lead to furthering a more modern approach to engagement, but rather cements a more traditional, less agile approach.
