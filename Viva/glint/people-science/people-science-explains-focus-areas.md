# Viva People Science explains focus areas and action planning 

The success of continuous conversations hinges on actions taken at the leadership and company levels, and which are based on feedback collected from their employees. Many companies build excitement and energy around concepts like “We want to hear from you!” and “Thank you for the feedback!” However, the momentum often slows somewhere between “Here’s what we’re going to do about your feedback,” and what actually gets done to address issues and make positive, incremental changes.

Initiating and managing action after a survey can be an unclear process. Focused and streamlined action planning is essential. An action plan is a written commitment to make incremental improvements to the employee experience and engagement in their work, on your team, and within the company. 

## Viva Glint’s Approach to Focus Areas

Glint’s Focus Areas module is designed to directly connect managers to recommended focus areas and resources for taking action based on their team’s results. Leaders are immediately able to see strengths and opportunities, review best practices, and select focus areas. 

Managers receive recommended focus areas based on their scores and drivers most impactful to engagement within their team. Viva Glint’s algorithm provides personalized recommendations based on score, comparison to *Company Average,* the selected benchmark, and the impact of particular areas on the outcome of interest.

Research shows that focusing on one area at a time maximizes the ability to achieve improvements between more frequent surveys. While managers own and drive only one focus area for their team, they can also champion and support their roll-up teams' focus areas.

### Help leaders move from a ‘big event’ mentality around action planning

Viewing new survey results against prior focus areas and action plans help teams determine whether it’s best to:

- Continue with prior focus areas and action plans. For example, if focus area results show some improvement, let’s maintain the momentum.
- Modify prior action plans to improve effectiveness. For example, if focus area results have declined, let’s revisit our plan to improve it.
- Focus on a new area. For example, if more pressing areas surface due to scores, employee sentiment, or business needs, change course.

## Why develop Focus Areas?

Choosing focus areas demonstrates commitment to continually improving the employee experience and, ultimately, changing leaders’ habits. Involving employees in understanding feedback and partnering with them to take action makes this process and progress meaningful and builds trust. 

Action planning content is sourced from industry best practices and Viva Glint's experience across a wide range of organizations. The content is written to be as attainable and easy to implement. Managers are guided through an intuitive framework to help build their own concrete action plans, leveraging learnings from how other managers engage their teams.
- An extensive resource library helps users understand why recommended focus areas are important and how to attain them.
- An easy-to-use interface allows managers to choose, organize, and prioritize actions by adding suggested tasks or creating their own.
- Prescribed actions include interactive and lightweight self-assessments, team discussion tips, and case studies.

Your organization can add custom content to leverage its own learning resources and to reflect company-specific values, initiatives, or strategies. You can add links to current content on internal and external sites to broaden educational opportunities.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The biggest risk for an organization is sending out a survey, collecting feedback, and failing to act upon it. Viva Glint offers an array of support resources to ensure effective action planning, communication of progress, and a perceptible boost to business outcomes.
