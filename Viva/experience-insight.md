Insights, like those in the Viva Insights app, in a Briefing email in Outlook, or in a personal Dashboard, help employees learn about how they work and what they can change. They'll get recommendations such as protecting time in the day for regular breaks, using focus time, and staying connected with colleagues.

[Teamwork habits](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/teamwork-habits) - Teamwork habits gives visibility into work habits that might lead to burnout and stress. These habits include regular after-hours work, meeting overload, or too little focus time. Team managers can use these insights to help their teams strike a balance between productivity and wellbeing. They can also learn how their habits impact their team while getting suggestions on how to foster team culture.

[Organization trends](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/org-trends) - Organization trends helps qualifying managers and business leaders see how their work culture is affecting aspects of employee wellbeing and productivity. They can use the recommendations on the Outcomes page to see opportunities where a change could improve their business outcomes.
