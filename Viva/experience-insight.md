### Learn how Viva Insights works:

[Personal insights](/viva/insights/personal/teams/viva-teams-app) - Employees can get personal insights that only they can see. Insights, like those in the Viva Insights app, in a Briefing email in Outlook, or in a personal Dashboard, help employees learn about how they work and what they can change. They'll get recommendations such as protecting time in the day for regular breaks, using focus time, and staying connected with colleagues. They'll have the ability to book things like focus time within Viva Insights.

[Teamwork habits](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/teamwork-habits) - Teamwork habits gives visibility into work habits that might lead to burnout and stress. These habits include regular after-hours work, meeting overload, or too little focus time. Team managers can use these insights to help their teams strike a balance between productivity and wellbeing. They can also learn how their habits impact their team while getting suggestions on how to foster team culture.

[Organization trends](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/org-trends) - Organization trends helps qualifying managers and business leaders see how their work culture is affecting aspects of employee wellbeing and productivity. They can use the recommendations on the Outcomes page to see opportunities where a change could improve their business outcomes.

[Advanced insights](/viva/insights/advanced/introduction-to-advanced-insights) - Similar to Organization trends, Advanced insights can also help business leaders address critical questions about organizational resiliency and work culture with insight into how work impacts their people and their business. Leaders can see opportunities where a change in process could improve business outcomes and take steps to protect employee wellbeing.
