# Combine Microsoft Viva apps to support popular business scenarios

Microsoft Viva apps can be combined to create powerful employee experiences for common business scenarios. Use this guidance for inspiration about how your organization can use combinations of Viva apps to meet specific needs. Each scenario can be supported by two Viva apps. Optionally, you can combine three or more Viva apps to create an even more effective experience. Then, get specific guidance on how to get started planning and deploying your solution.

**Scenarios in this article**:

- Training and onboarding
- Wellness and work-life balance
- Knowledge sharing and management

## Training and onboarding

Onboard new employees or volunteers and encourage them to learn new skills with the combination of Viva Learning and Viva Connections. Create a training experience that people can access on desktop and mobile devices and that you can target to specific audiences. Consider also adding Viva Topics to help your organization manage internal projects, subject matter experts, and terminology. Viva Insights can add even more features for onboarding.

Help your employees manage their time effectively and create a healthy workplace culture with Viva Insights, Viva Learning, and Viva Connections. First, use Viva Insights to gain an understanding of your team’s work habits. Then, create or source learning content to encourage healthy workplace practices. Finally, add Viva Connections to share communications and resources about wellness and workplace practices.

### App 1: Viva Insights

Understand your organization’s workplace habits and how your team spends their time.

3. Enable [team insights](insights/org-team-insights/team-insights.md) for employees to learn more about their teams’ unique habits and understand how their habits can set a good example.
4. Enable [personal insights](insights/personal/introduction.md) for employees to learn how to make the most of their time at work. Viva Insights helps employees be more proactive in protecting their schedule by setting up a [focus plan](insights/personal/teams/focus-plan.md) and a [virtual commute](insights/personal/teams/virtual-commute.md).

4. Managers and leaders can [recommend](https://support.microsoft.com/office/recommend-and-manage-content-in-viva-learning-77f9dcbf-41a8-4b19-b4d1-b99c406f37b8) content to specific users, and users can search for content to empower themselves.

### App 1: Viva Topics

Empower employees to find the information and contacts that they need to do their best work.

When an employee sees a term that they want to know more about, they can highlight a word or phrase within the tool, right-click and choose the option to search the highlighted word.
