# Yume - Overview

Yume is an employee-driven solution to support 1:1 interaction between employees and their managers. It empowers employees to shape 1:1 meetings through topics (cards) that make discussions more meaningful. Employees can build and structure the agenda for an upcoming 1:1 meeting using the cards, which contain content that is simple and easy to access during the meeting. The employees can also refer to cards and key notes from previous 1:1 meetings and prepare cards for the future 1:1 meetings, promoting continuity and evolution of 1:1 meetings. There's also an option for employees to provide their feedback on the 1:1 interaction immediately once the meeting ends.

## Use case

1.	An employee has a challenge (for example, work-life balance and personal situation) that they want to bring up to their manager, but is unsure how to.
2.	An employee wants to explore, discuss and/or focus on their career growth and development.
3.	An employee is a new hire and wants to build a relationship with their new manager.
