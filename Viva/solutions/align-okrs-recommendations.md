# Alignment Recommendations

Looking to improve your healthy OKR program? Here are recommendations you can perform within Viva Goals: 

1. **Ensure that Organizational Objectives are set** 
    1. Make sure that senior leadership has entered high level objectives into Viva Goals, which will allow departments to align up to these “north star” goals.  

1. **Ensure that Team level Objectives align up to parent Organizational Objectives** 
    1. Remember that these Objectives shouldn't be identical to the ones above it, but *in support* of them. 
    
1. **Explore areas where common Objectives can be shared across groups through multiple alignment**
    1. Multiple alignment helps avoid siloed workstreams and ties multiple groups to a common purpose.
