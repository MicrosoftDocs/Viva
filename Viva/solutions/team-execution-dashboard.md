# Team Execution Dashboard and ROB 

Organizations can incorporate OKRs into their rhythm of business (ROB) by using dashboards across key meetings and activities in order to build a healthy OKR program. 

**OKR Value Driver:**  Team Execution Dashboard and ROB 

**Objective of this meeting:** The purpose of this activity is to drive week-by-week progress and execution of goals for your team. Teams should focus on leading indicators, get to the "why" of hot issues, keep a tab on OKRs and metrics, track project initiatives closely, and understand priorities for the upcoming week. 

Imagine attending the weekly status meeting with your team, and your manager asks about the progress you’ve made in the last week. Without Viva Goals and updated OKRs, you may have responded with a panicked mumble or a vague, meaningless answer. But now, since you give your dashboard a glance every week, you’re able to say “Doing great! We’re tracking at 80% complete on our highest priority objective, and the other two have made it past the halfway mark.” And just like that, you’ve impressed your manager. 

**Who is involved**

- **Meeting owner:** Team manager
- **Audience:** Team members

**Meeting/communication categories**

These are communication types that you might already have in your existing rhythm of business. Remember, we’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather, incorporate OKRs into your existing workflow.  

- Weekly team meetings 
- Daily “standup” or scrum meetings 

**How OKRs help**

- Drives ownership and accountability in the flow of work  
- Surfaces key areas of collaboration across teams   
- Highlights key opportunities for course correction  
- Leverages OKRs to report up or across to key contributors on overall progress 

**Key milestone**

Team-level dashboard report to communicate what was accomplished as a team, what was learned, what challenges exist, what help is needed, and what comes next.  

## Department Alignment Dashboard

The dashboard for a cross-department meeting might have the following elements, or widgets, within Viva Goals. 


|Widget type   |Widget name   |Use  |Benefit  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Text block      |Agenda         |Communicate the agenda for the meeting. |Helps set the context for everyone for the meeting.          |
|Text block      |Updates from last week          |Used to communicate wins, key learnings, current blockers, help needed, and upcoming steps.          |Enables all team members to get a holistic snapshot of recent progress.         |
|OKR detail      |OKR detailed view          |Gives a granular look into the progress of each OKR.          |Allows you to discuss every single OKR, address concerns about whether the OKR will be achieved, and get to the root cause of any problems.          |
|Text block      |Hot issues          |Communicate hot issues that have come up since the last weekly review meeting so that tactical items outside OKRs are also tracked.          |Ensures the most pressing issues are brought up and addressed quickly.          |
|Initiative list      |Project initiatives          |Lets everyone periodically review initiatives in the context of OKRs and gain greater visibility into work that’s driving the progress of OKRs.          |Focus on initiatives to make sure your team works on the initiatives that drive results.          |

## How to run Team Execution meeting

Unlike higher level meetings for leadership strategy, organizational visibility, or departmental alignment, meetings for team execution give you the opportunity to get more into the details of your objectives, key results, and initiatives. 

This is critical to driving the day-to-day and week-to-week progress that will ultimately lead to significant wins each quarter.  

Planning and execution of the meeting’s rhythm of business might look like this: 

### Step 1: Update your OKRs 

Before your meeting happens, ensure your team has updated their OKRs with the latest information to discuss. Having check-in reminder notifications set up 24 hours prior to the meeting helps keep your team up to date.  

### Step 2: Review OKRs with the team 

Put your dashboard up on the screen and dive in! If time allows, have each team member give a quick update, or alternate a representative each week to share progress. To make the best use of your time, have the team go over goals they're struggling with first, which helps you remain focused on high priority work. Identify and address OKRs marked "behind" or "at risk" in the past week, and drill down to understand details. You can use the "compare to previous" feature to quickly identify which OKRs are moving forward and which have stalled.  

### Step 3: Celebrate wins 

It’s also important to spend some time reviewing what’s going right, giving kudos, and celebrating wins. Identify what circumstances or actions helped those OKR progress forward, and use this opportunity to see if you can apply these learnings to any of your behind or at-risk objectives.  

### Step 4: Make adjustments 

Your next step is to revise your approach towards objectives that are at-risk. Being agile is part of the OKR methodology – so don’t be afraid to make adjustments as needed. Look to OKR owners to help identify any barriers to progress.  

### Step 5: Define action items and next steps 

Spend time recapping the action items that will be a priority over the next week. This helps everyone stay focused until you meet again.
