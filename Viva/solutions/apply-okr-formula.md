# How to turn good OKRs to great OKRs

Apply the OKR framework to a real-world business example in order to improve your OKRs. This OKR example will show you how to take your OKRs from good to great.

## Follow the formulas

Let’s start with the first draft of a broad objective:

**Objective: Make more money**

While most businesses do need to make money, this objective is poorly written that needs to be edited.

It’s not actionable, aspirational, or meaningful, and it doesn’t follow our formula.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verb + what you’re going to do + so that / in order to

We can edit this objective to be:

**Objective: Expand into Latin America in order to increase product market share**

This objective is much more meaningful, follows the formula, and drives the business forward.

Now let’s look at three Key Results that span across Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing.

1. Key Result: Increase new product sales (Sales)  
1. Key Result: Increase social media views (Marketing)  
1. Key Result: Increase qualified leads (Marketing) 

These key results aren’t bad, but in order to follow the formula so we can successfully measure progress, we need to include some numbers. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verb + what you’re going to track / count + from x to y

1. Key Result: Increase new product sales from $100k to $ 1.5 m (Sales)  
1. Key Result: Increase social media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing)  
1. Key Result: Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing) 

## Apply the OKR benefits

After confirming your objectives and key results follow their respective formulas, you need to ask yourself some questions based in the OKR benefits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The long form versions of these benefits can be found in the [Write OKRs Overview](write-okrs-overview.md). A summarized version of the questions are as follows:
> 
> - **Alignment**: Who are our stakeholders?​
> - **Focus**: What can be eliminated?​  ​
> - **Transparency**: Where are there unseen implications or bottlenecks?​
> - **Adaptability**: Can we track if we were successful? 
> - **Growth**: Is it propelling the business forward?

What we realize when comparing these key results to our benefits is that we're lacking in alignment and haven't included one of our stakeholders- product. We're going to have difficulty increasing our product market share in Latin America if we don't have a product that appeals to that market. So we add a key result around growing a Spanish language version of the product

1. Increase new product sales from $100k to $ 1.5 m (Sales)  
1. Increase social media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing)  
1. Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing) 
1. **Increase users of Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product)**

## Perform the necessary and sufficient test

To further finalize our OKRs, we’ll apply the Necessary and Sufficient Test by asking ourselves:

- "Are all these Key Results **necessary** to achieve my Objective?"
- "Will accomplishing my Key Results be **sufficient** enough to achieve my Objective?" 
 
**"Are all these Key Results *necessary* to achieve my Objective?"**

When we think hard, we realize that increasing our social media views isn't absolutely necessary to meeting our Objective, so let’s remove that one. 

1. Increase new product sales from $100k to $ 1.5 m (Sales)
1. ~~ Increase social media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing)~~ 
1. Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing) 
1. Increase users of Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product) 

**"Will accomplishing my Key Results be *sufficient* enough to achieve my Objective?"**

What you realize is that you won’t be able to sufficiently achieve your goal without adding more spanish-speaking sales reps. So let’s add that final Key Result. 

1. Increase new product sales from $100k to $ 1.5 m (Sales)  
1. Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing) 
1. Increase users of Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product) 
1. **Increase bilingual sales staff from 2 to 5 (People)**

## Summary

As you can see, through several iterations, we took a vague objective (Make more money) and turned it into an inspirational, actionable, measurable set of OKRs by adding, removing, and editing key results.
