# Close Recommendations

Looking to improve your healthy OKR program? Here are recommendations you can perform within Viva Goals:

1. **Close and score your OKRs at the end of each time period**
    1. As you approach the end of a time period, encourage all OKR owners to close out their OKRs and initiatives, including a brief summary. Create and send calendar reminders at the beginning of the year as part of your rhythm of business so you donâ€™t forget.  

2. **Hold an OKR reflection meeting**
    1. Groups should set aside time to reflect on their OKRs, which will allow them to write better and better goals moving forward. 

1. **Review your OKR analytics** 
    1. Analytics are available at the organization and team level within Viva Goals, and display metrics such as number of OKRs closed, OKR efficiency, and OKR focus. Use these analytics to track the success of your program over time.
