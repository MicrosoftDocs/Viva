# Check-in OKRs and make updates with Viva Goals

An OKR check-in is a regular evaluation of the progress made towards the objectives set in the OKR framework.  

While the one time OKR writing process at the beginning of a time period and reflection process at the end of a time period are the “bookends” to create and score your goals, the check-in process is the critical work done regularly throughout the time period to measure progress and make sure you’re on track.  

In this article, you'll learn:

- How to define and describe the two types of check-ins within Viva Goals 
- See examples of a key result check-in, and which type to use  
- Detail the benefits of using data integrations for check-ins 

> [!NOTE]
> **Mindset:**  Before we get started, a quick reminder that when it comes to checking in, consistency is key. That said, we urge progress over perfection, so if you miss a series of check-ins, don’t beat yourself up and abandon the process. Just pick back up and continue through the rest of the time period. 

## Check-in definition 

A check-in is the process of updating the progress of your OKRs in Viva Goals, and should be done on an ongoing basis. This can either be done manually on a regular schedule decided by your organization, or automatically by integrating Viva Goals with an outside data source.

## How often to perform Check-ins 

Because the process of checking in only takes a few minutes – or can be automated completely – we recommend a weekly cadence for most organizations. The benefits of weekly check-ins are that more frequent updates of key metrics provide a clearer picture of progress, ensuring that goals remain on track or can be adjusted more quickly if falling behind. Other organizations may choose to require check-ins on a bi-weekly basis. 

## Two types of check-ins: manual and integrated 

There are two ways to update the progress of OKRs in Viva Goals:  manual and integrated.

### Manual check-in

> [!NOTE]
> Users manually enter the latest value of the metric they are tracking within Viva Goals. 

In most cases, it literally takes less than 10 seconds to perform a manual check-in. 

For example, let’s say you work on the Content and Training team, and one of your key results is around publishing new help articles: 

- **Key Result:** Increase customer-facing knowledge base articles from 25 to 100

So if it’s the first week of the quarter, you’re ready to do your first check-in, and you were able to publish five new articles, you would do these three simple steps: 

1. Navigate to that key result and select the check-in button 
1. Change the metric from 25 to 30 
1. Add a note such as “Great progress this week with five new articles” and select check-in 

That’s it! Viva Goals takes care of the rest, updating the progress on the graph, rolling up status to the overall objective, and displaying your check-in note for your manager or others to see in order to get more context. 

### Integrated check-in

> [!NOTE]
> OKR progress is updated automatically with a data integration source such as Azure DevOps, or via a collaboration platform such as Microsoft Teams.

**Data integration:** What could be better than a check-in process that takes less than 10 seconds? With a Viva Goals data integration, the progress of an OKR is automatically updated every hour via a third party data source such as Azure DevOps or Microsoft Excel.

Let’s revisit the example we used earlier: 

- **Key Result:** Increase customer-facing knowledge base articles from 25 to 100

If the Content and Training team is actively tracking their article count in a project management tool such as Azure Dev Ops, they can link ADO directly to their Viva Goals key result.  

In this manner, rather than manually entering the numbers each week (ie, changing the progress from 25 to 30), the integration would pull data automatically from ADO hourly so that whenever an article was marked as published, that update would be reflected in Viva Goals. 

If the most current numbers are needed outside of the hourly update (for example, you’re about to present at a monthly OKR review meeting), you can select the Sync button to ensure the metrics are fully updated. 

**Collaboration integration:** Users can also perform a check-in directly from within collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams or Slack. In this manner, users can remain in the tools they're already using and stay in the flow of work, making tracking seamless.

## Benefits of Viva Goals data integrations 

Viva Goals supports integration with industry-leading tools and platforms you use every day, so your OKR implementation process is as simple, effective, and seamless as possible.  

Using integrations has several advantages: 

- Check-ins are done automatically, eliminating the need to do so manually 
- All data is brought in from a single source of truth, eliminating redundancy 
- Users can stay in the flow of work with tools they're already using, avoiding time switching back and forth 

Viva Goals supports a broad range of third-party integrations. See a comprehensive list of supported integrations here: [Viva Goals integrations overview](../goals/integrations-overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integrations must first be set up be an administrator, but then individual users can configure the connection to their OKR. For more information: [Viva Goals Integrations Administration Overview](../goals/vg-integrations-administration-overview.md).

## Check-in OKRs with Viva Goals

Now that you’ve seen the “why” around aligning your OKRs, see the step-by-step process “how” to collaborate, align, and view your OKRs in the Microsoft Viva Goals software platform: [Collaborate and Align with Viva Goals](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/collaborate-with-viva-goals-43673d1c-0dd7-42ba-97aa-6e712db171d1).

## Summary

The OKR check-in process is the critical work done regularly (weekly or bi-weekly) throughout a time period to measure progress and make sure you’re on track. Users can perform check-ins quickly and easily within the web app, automatically with third-party integrations, or via collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams.
