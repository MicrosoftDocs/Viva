# Integrate Viva Glint and Viva Insights to maximize data insight (preview)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is available to preview customers only. Features described here are subject to change.

Organizational leaders, HR analysts, and other stakeholders can bring Microsoft Viva Glint and Microsoft Viva Insights together into the rhythm of their business to better understand their people’s full work experience.   

Integrating your Viva Glint employee survey scores (how employees feel) with your Viva Insights data (how people work) helps identify your teams’ opportunities and strengths to meet organizational goals. 

To send data from Viva Glint surveys to Viva Insights, the survey data must meet [Glint’s confidentiality thresholds](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2275271). All languages supported by Glint for question labels and question texts are sent to Insights.

## Scenarios for using Insights and Glint together 

- **As a manager or leader**, you may want to see how different behaviors impact engagement levels for your team after a recent engagement survey. You can use the Glint Team Summary dashboard to see how different behaviors impact engagement.   With this information, you can look for patterns and use those patterns to find strengths and opportunities within your team. Then, in Viva Insights, look at how different advanced metrics - like manager 1:1 time or after-hours work - impact various engagement drivers, and take action if needed.     

- **As a leader**, you may want to look across teams to see how different behaviors impact engagement levels and different engagement drivers. Use the Glint Heatmap report to see how different Viva Insights metrics- like collaboration hours or network size - impact engagement. You can see which teams are doing well for engagement and which teams might be struggling. Filter further in the employee comments by specific behaviors to understand what employees are saying about their experience. With this knowledge, you can work with specific teams in areas to improve productivity.  

- **As an HR analyst**, you may want to better understand how your recent Viva Glint engagement survey relates to collaboration data from Viva Insights. Use the Glint with Viva Insights PowerBI template to see how engagement scores relate to behavior. Use the Overview tab in the PowerBI template to quickly highlight which behaviors have a strong relationship to different engagement drivers. Explore these relationships further by looking at specific Glint survey items and compare them to different behavioral metrics and teams.
