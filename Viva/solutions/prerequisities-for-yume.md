# Step 1 - Prerequisites for setup of Yume

## Download the Yume accelerator

Download the Yume accelerator from the samples in the [VivaSolutions GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/VivaSolutions/tree/main/Sample%20Solutions) from the server itself.

## Set working hours and days for users mailbox settings

We recommend the working hours and days to be set for the users who will be using the application for more accurate working hours calculations. For information on how to set working hours and days for user mailbox settings, see [Set-MailboxCalendarConfiguration](/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailboxcalendarconfiguration). If not set, a default value of 45 hours will be used.
