# Write effective OKRs that inspire action and deliver results.

One of the best ways to enable a healthy OKR program with Viva Goals is to make sure that you are writing effective OKRs that inspire your team to action and deliver on the results you are seeking.

Why is it important to have well-written OKRs? Two reasons. First, writing clear, easy-to-understand, and aspirational Objectives helps align all team members towards a common purpose. When everyone in the company shares the same vision, and can easily articulate it, it inspires action. Second, writing concise, specific, and measurable Key Results allows you to track and monitor success along the way. Knowing your metrics in real time will let you know if you’re on track to meet your goals or need to adjust.

In this article, you will learn:

- How to define an Objective, Key Result, and Initiative
- How to identify best practices and common pitfalls when writing OKRs
- A simple framework for crafting OKRs quickly and easily

> [!NOTE]
> **Mindset:** Before we get started, a quick reminder that writing OKRs is an iterative process—the more you write, the better you will become. That’s why we strongly urge focusing on progress over perfection.
> 
> If you already have some basic strategic goals set for your company, it’s far more important to make initial progress, enter those into the system, and build on them, rather than get hung up trying to craft the perfect metric. So for now, keep it simple and have some fun. 

## OKR definitions

Let’s start with a quick recap. **OKR** stands for **Objectives and Key Results.** Along with Initiatives, they act like a compass to direct you toward your goals.

- **Objectives** are what your team wants to accomplish. They are 3-5 clear, inspiring goals shared across teams and organizations.

- **Key Results** are how the team will measure results. They should be 3-5 measurable outcomes which contribute to the achievement of an objective.

- **Initiatives** are actions that help the team achieve outcomes. They are focused efforts that will help you define the path to impact for each OKR.

Let’s dig into Objectives a bit deeper … What does the team want to accomplish?

Whether you’re the CEO of your organization, or the department lead in your group, what meaningful goals do you want to accomplish?

These goals should be clear, concise, and inspirational. We like to say that it should be like a slogan that will fit on a t-shirt. Remember to keep things simple and focused … just 3-5 goals max.

Now let’s dig into Key Results. If Objectives are the aspirational words of a leader, Key Results are the specific numbers and metrics of a scientist.

If an employee later asked if the team accomplished the goals they set out to achieve, the result should be clear, measurable, and not open to interpretation. Once again, keep things focused by limiting to 3-5 Key Results for each Objective.

Lastly, Initiatives are actions that help the team achieve outcomes. They are focused efforts that will help you define the path to impact for each OKR.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When thinking about Key Results vs. Initiatives:
> 
> - Key Results are outcomes—the level of performance or achievement you're trying to reach—the outcome you want to happen.  
> 
> - Initiatives are outputs—the list of activities you're performing to get there—the output to make those things happen.

## Common pitfalls

With that baseline, let’s look at avoiding missteps:

- Creating too many objectives or key results, thus losing focus
- Setting unrealistic or ambiguous goals
- Using OKRs as your task list or to-do list
- Writing OKRs as “business as usual” projects that don’t drive impact
- Writing key results that aren’t measurable, so defining progress is vague
- Setting KRs for metrics your team doesn't have the ability to control or impact

## OKR framework

The challenge with learning how to write great OKRs is that every business is different.

- A SaaS company might want to measure monthly recurring revenue and churn
- A media company might track page views and time on site
- A retail company might track sales per square foot and stock turnover

Senior leaders tend to think bigger picture and need aspirational goals, while managers need OKRs that are more action-oriented.

The good news is, there’s a solution to this challenge: using an overall framework applicable to most any situation:

"I will **OBJECTIVE** as measured by **KEY RESULTS** via **INITIATIVES.**"

### Objective formula

Objectives are actionable, aspirational, and meaningful.

Step 1: Questions to ask before writing Objectives

- What is the most important area of our business that we need to focus on?  
- Why does this goal matter to us?  
- How would we write our objective into a statement that inspires our team?

Step 2: Formula to follow when writing Objectives

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verb + what you’re going to do + so that / in order to

In this formula, the verb is your action, what you're going to do is your aspiration, and the phrase "so that" or "in order to" is your meaning.

> [!NOTE]
> Example: Deliver a “must-have” product in order to delight customers and grow our user base 

### Key result formula

Key results are focused, measurable, and ambitious.

Step 1: Questions to ask before writing Key Results

- How will we know if we’re successful?
- How can we measure the impact of our work?
- What metric or outcome would let us measure definitively if we were successful?
- Do we currently measure that metric?
- What is our best-case scenario for achievement on that measure?

Step 2: Formula to follow when writing Key Results

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verb + what you’re going to track / count + from x to y

In this formula, the verb is your action, what you are going to track or count is your area of focus, the X to Y is your measure; the difference between the X and Y is the level of ambition you're trying to achieve.

> Example: Increase our NPS score from 40 to 50

### Initiatives formula

Initiatives are outputs that help inform the success of your outcomes.

Step 1: Questions to ask before writing Initiatives

- What do we need to do in order to be successful?
- What can we get done in this period?
- Who needs to be involved?

Step 2: Formula to follow when writing Initiatives

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verb + what you’re going to do

In this formula, the verb is your action and what you are going to do is the output of your initiative.

### Review and edit

Once you’ve sketched out a draft of your OKRs, we recommend stepping back and asking yourself a few questions to help refine them. It’s often helpful to literally step away...take a break from writing and come back the following day with fresh eyes to review.

Then, look at each OKR through the lens of the 5 key OKR benefits:

**Alignment**

Have you aligned your goals from the top down, bottom up, and across teams to ensure everyone is driving towards the same purpose, across the organization? Do we have the right owners identified who will feel accountability for driving progress?

**Focus**

Have you limited both Objectives and the Key Results below them to 3-5 at most? It can be difficult at first to narrow down your goals when everything seems to be a priority, but remember, “If everything is important, then nothing is.”

**Transparency**

Are your OKRs public for all team members to see in order to create accountability and surface dependencies and roadblocks? Can our team directly impact Key Results or are we reliant on stakeholders? If the latter, can we make this a shared OKR?

**Adaptability**

Have you set up integrations to a single source of truth where possible to enable faster and better decision making based on dynamic real-time data and insights? Will we be able to see progress on each Key Result in the current time frame?

**Growth**

Do your OKRs go beyond “business as usual” to strive for ambitious outcomes and reaching for what’s possible?

### Finalizing your OKRs

A great way to finalize your OKRs is to take the necessary and sufficient test.

In looking at an OKR, ask yourself, "Are all these Key Results necessary to achieve my Objective?"

- If the answer is yes, then it passes the necessary test.
- If the answer is no, then remove what isn't needed.

Next, ask yourself, "Will accomplishing my Key Results be sufficient enough to achieve my Objective?"

- If yes, then it passes the sufficient test and you're good to go.
- If no, then modify existing Key Results to make them stronger, and add any Key Results to achieve your Objective.

## Enter OKRs into Viva Goals

Now that you’ve seen the “why” around writing great OKRs, see the step-by-step process “how” to enter your OKRs into the Microsoft Viva Goals software platform: [Create Objectives, Key Results, and Initiatives with Viva Goals ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/create-objectives-key-results-and-projects-with-viva-goals-0587147d-84ed-438f-8a24-5c75f539814c)

## Summary

Objectives and Key Results, along with Initiatives, act like a compass to direct you toward your goals. Learning to write great OKRs is an iterative process, so we strongly urge focusing on progress over perfection. To get up to speed quickly, it’s far more important to make initial progress, enter those into the system, and build on them, rather than get hung up trying to craft the perfect metric.

- **Objectives** should be clear, concise, and inspirational, and limited to just 3-5. To get started, follow the formula Verb + what you’re going to do + so that / in order to
- **Key Results**are how the team will measure results, and should also be limited to 3-5. They are the measurable outcomes which contribute to the achievement of an objective.
- **Initiatives** are actions that help the team achieve outcomes; the focused efforts that will help you define the path to impact for each OKR.

There are many pitfalls to avoid when writing OKRs, such as writing goals that are ambiguous, business-as-usual, not measurable, or too much like a to do list.

But the top issue organizations usually have is around focus. When companies get stuck, it’s usually because they’ve set way too many goals. The answer is almost always “less is more” and scaling back to do a few things great vs. 50 things just ok.
