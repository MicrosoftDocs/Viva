# Departmental Alignment Dashboard and ROB 

Organizations can incorporate OKRs into their rhythm of business (ROB) by using dashboards across key meetings and activities in order to build a healthy OKR program. 

**OKR Value Driver:**  Drive cross department alignment

**Objective of this meeting:** The purpose of this activity is to gather a cross section of departments, divisions, or teams to share progress and ensure alignment and awareness of dependencies to help drive successful completion of their respective work.

Organizations can be complex, and bringing together cross functional groups regularly to share their OKRs helps drive clarity, surface dependencies, and allow for real time adjustments.  

In the real world, likely outcomes could be: two groups working on similar projects (which could be combined), marketing getting ready to announce key features (but product isn’t ready to release them), delays to key projects being surfaced (with others jumping in to help), or team members simply saying “Wow, that’s the first I’ve heard of that new feature/topic/win” (how cool!).  

Surfacing these issues in a cross-department meeting involving OKRs save time, energy, and money, and prevents teams planning in a silo and either not sharing outcomes at all or only sharing at the end when it's too late to course correct. 

While communicating across teams is always key, this is often most important as you roll out OKRs more broadly in your organization and are driving cascaded / multi-tier OKR programs as additional teams are added and begin adopting Viva Goals. 

**Who is involved**

- **Meeting owner:** CEO, Chief of Staff, or OKR Program Lead 
- **Audience:** Key stakeholders from each department, division, or team 

**Meeting/communication categories**

These are communication types that you might already have in your existing rhythm of business. Remember, we’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather, incorporate OKRs into your existing workflow. 

- Monthly department meetings 
- Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) 

**How OKRs help**

- Drives progress against commits during planning process   
- Maintains clarity against shared objectives / dependencies / priorities 
- Ensures ongoing, consistent accountability toward goals 
- Delivers transparency, so all groups know what everyone is working on 
- Provides continuous and real-time adjustments on progress  

**Key milestone**

Department-level dashboard report for leaders to communicate what was accomplished this period, what was learned, what help is needed, and what comes next. 

## Department Alignment Dashboard

The dashboard for a cross-department meeting might have the following elements, or widgets, within Viva Goals. 

|Widget type   |Widget name   |Use  |Benefit  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Text block      |Agenda        |Communicate the agenda for the meeting.        |Helps set the context for everyone for the meeting.         |
|Text block      |Updates from last time period          |Used to communicate wins, key learnings, current blockers, help needed, and upcoming steps.          |Enables all team members to get a holistic snapshot of recent progress.          |
|OKR list      |View current objectives          |List top level OKRs to demonstrate progress against goals.          |Enables all team members to have transparency into how the organization is tracking against their metrics.          |

## How to run Department Alignment meeting

Running a series of departmental check-in meetings can require some logistics, but the payoff of greater organizational communication makes it well worth the effort. 

Smaller companies might be able to have a single 1-hour meeting where department leads “go around the room” and give a quick update of their OKRs. 

Larger enterprises, however, may opt to have a series of back-to-back meetings that focus on each department, with plenty of time for questions and answers. It helps to have a highly organized, well-respected point person to coordinate this activity. This could be a Chief of Staff, Senior Program Manager, or the OKR Program Lead. 

Planning and execution of the meeting’s rhythm of business might look like this: 

### Step 1: Meeting announcement and preparation 

**Communication sent:** 10 days before the meeting 

**Purpose:** Give meeting participants advanced notice to prepare their dashboard presentations 

> [!TIP]
> Hello! 
> 
> The month end is quickly approaching and our next cross-department alignment meeting is scheduled for March 2. 
> 
> In preparation for our meeting, please send me the link to your department’s review dashboard by 5pm PT on February 27.  I will be sending out the pre-read that evening. 
> 
> As a reminder, content for your dashboard should focus on Objectives and Key Results to avoid deep dives into deliverables (vs. outcomes). 
> 
> Please ensure the content you will be presenting will fit into the allotted time noted below for your area as we will not have time to extend into the next meeting. 
> 
> |Department  |Owner  |Time Allotted   |
> |---------|---------|---------|
> |Customer Success      |Jacob Hancock          |40 minutes          |
> |User Experience     |Ana Bowman          |40 minutes          |
> |Sales and Marketing      |Kiana Anderson          |40 minutes          |
> |Finance     |Wesley Brooks          |40 minutes          |
> |Operations      |Preston Morales          |40 minutes          |
> |Product and Engineering      |Mateo Gomez          |40 minutes          |
> 
> If you have any questions, please let me know. 
> 
> Thank you, 
> 
> Ellen Bennett, Chief of Staff 

### Step 2: Agenda set and pre-read dashboards shared

**Communication sent:** Three days before the meeting 

**Purpose:** Provide strict time constraints for dashboard walkthroughs, and send out department-level dashboards as a pre-read so that meeting time can be used for discussion, not reading

> [!TIP]
> Hello! 
> 
> Our monthly cross-department alignment meeting is scheduled for Thursday, March 2.  Please find the agenda below, as well as links to the associated dashboards. 
> 
> Action: Please assign an individual from your group who will be responsible for taking 	notes and sharing action items for your area.
> 
> |Start/End  |Department  |Owner  |Dashboard Link   |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|
> |8:15am to 8:55am |Customer Success          |Jacob Hancock          |CS Dashboard          |
> |9:05am to 9:45am     |User Experience          |Ana Bowman          |UX Team Dashboard          |
> |9:50am to 10:30am      |Sales and Marketing          |Kiana Anderson          |Sales & Marketing           |
> |10:40am to 11:00am     |Finance          |Wesley Brooks          |Finance Dashboard          |
> |11:05 to 11:45am     |Operations         |Preston Morales          |Ops Team Dashboard          |
> |11:50am to 1:00pm     |Product and Engineering          |Mateo Gomez          |Product & Engineering Team Dashboard          |
> 
> Please ensure you have the Outlook invite on your calendar, and forward to the appropriate meeting participants. 
> 
> Thank you, 
> 
> Ellen Bennett, Chief of Staff 

### Step 3: Solicit questions from attendees 

**Communication sent:** Two days before the meeting 

**Purpose:** With dashboards now available for all to read, attendees can seed a few high level questions about areas they’d like to explore or get more information. This allows time for presenters to add any additional elements to their dashboard, and prepare for questions in advance instead of being put on the spot. 

> [!TIP]
> Hello, 
> 
> Please send any questions you may have for the presenters/departments based on the dashboard pre-reads by 5pm PT on February 28.  I will consolidate all questions and send the final list to the presenters so they can be prepared to discuss during our meeting. 
> 
> Please let me know if you have any questions. 
> 
> Thank you, 
> 
> Ellen Bennett, Chief of Staff 

### Step 4: Provide questions to presenters 

**Communication sent:** One day before the meeting 

**Purpose:** Provide presenters with questions they may be asked.

> [!TIP]
> Hello, 
> 
> Please find the consolidated questions/topics for the presenters/departments based on the pre-reads.  Please come prepared to discuss these during our meeting. 
> 
> [list of questions] 
> 
> Ellen 

### Step 5: Running the meeting 

**Purpose:** Share information across departments to ensure alignment to organizational goals. 

The day of the meeting(s) is finally here! It's the role of the Chief of Staff / point person to “run a tight ship” and make sure people stick to the agenda.  

> [!NOTE]
> It might take a few cycles to get things fully dialed in, and that’s ok. For instance, in the example shown, perhaps every department was originally allotted 30 minutes. But over time, the group decided to expand most departments to 40 minutes, while cutting back the Finance team to 20 minutes and expanding the Product and Engineering time to 80 minutes based on the depth of topics.  
> 
> Each cycle, there will invariably be one team that gets their dashboard in late, one person that goes on too long, and one attendee that asks too many questions. However, over time people generally settle into the proper “business rhythm” and everyone will benefit from the meeting.

**Agenda:**

- Department lead gives a high-level monthly summary. (5 minutes) 
    - What went well 
    - Key learnings and opportunities 
    - Risks and help needed 
- Since each department generally owns 3-5 OKRs, the team member most responsible for each Objective gives a 5-minute update on each goal. This helps drive accountability, involves team members, and builds a culture of OKRs. (15-25 minutes) 
    - Progress review of the 3-5 Key Result metrics 
    - Updates on any Projects and Initiatives
    - What went well / wins
    - Key learnings and opportunities
    - Risks and help needed
    - Next steps 
- Any questions answered and clarification. (10-20 minutes) 

During the meeting, someone is designated to take notes and record follow-up action items. 

### Step 6: Meeting follow-up 

**Communication sent:** One day after the meeting 

**Purpose:** Distribute meeting summary and action items for attendees, and links to recordings for those that couldn't attend.

> [!TIP]
> Hello, 
> 
> Thank you for attending the OKR Monthly Departmental meeting on March 2. Please make sure to review the meeting notes here [Monthly OKR Review Notes March.docx] and action items here [Monthly OKR Review Action Items March.xlsx].  
> 
> If you missed a meeting or would like to go back to review for notes/action items, please find the list of dashboards and meeting recording links below. 
>

> Thank you,
