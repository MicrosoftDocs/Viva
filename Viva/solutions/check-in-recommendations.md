# Check-in Recommendations

Looking to improve the efficiency of your OKR program? Here are recommendations you can perform within Viva Goals: 

1. **Set up automated key result check-ins through data integrations**
    1. Action: Go through each key result and determine if the data is already being tracked in a supported third party program, and whenever possible, use integrations to automatically pull from a single source of truth. For example: 
        1. Are your sales numbers already in Salesforce? Link it directly to your key result so that sales figures update in real time.  
        1. If the data isn't yet in a third party app, can it be added? If your team’s thrive score, customer service NPS ranking, or conference attendance numbers are currently being tracked in multiple locations, consolidate them in an Excel spreadsheet as the source of truth and link that to key results.

2. **Connect to collaboration platforms like Teams and Slack for easier check-ins**
    1. If you and your organization use Microsoft Teams or Slack, connect them to Viva Goals to enjoy seamless usage right from those products. 
        1. With Microsoft Teams, you can install, pin, and interact with Viva Goals directly within the Teams app. You can create, check in, track progress, and close OKRs. 
        1. With Slack, you can create and edit OKRs, make check-ins, and get timely updates and reminders.

1. **Set up check-in reminder notifications** 
    1. The OKR Program Lead should determine the cadence of OKR reminders, (such as once per week on Friday mornings) and work with the Viva Goals Admin to set these up in the admin dashboard. Sometimes all users need to update their OKRs is a small nudge to remind them. 
    1. Bonus tip: “Habit stack” to encourage employees to check in their OKRs at the same time each week. “Habit stacking” is pairing a habit you're trying to build, such as OKR check-ins, with an already existing habit, such as updating a weekly report for a team meeting.
