# Leadership Strategy Dashboard and ROB 

Organizations can incorporate OKRs into their rhythm of business (ROB) by using dashboards across key meetings and activities in order to build a healthy OKR program.

**OKR Value Driver:** Drive strategic planning and alignment.

**Objective of this meeting:** The purpose of this activity is to drive strategic planning at the senior leadership level. It's often started in the Launching phase of an OKR rollout to share a common vision, and continued to make sure senior leadership is kept in alignment. 

Annual strategic planning is generally run by the CEO or senior leader of a division. The meeting is with members of the senior leadership team, and serves to set the goals for the year.  

From there, quarterly and monthly meetings are run by the CEO or often their Chief of Staff. The meeting is with members of the senior leadership team and serves to make sure the goals for a given time period are on track. 

**Who is involved**

- **Meeting owner:** CEO, Organizational lead, or Chief of Staff 
- **Audience:** Senior leadership team 

**Meeting categories**

These are meeting types that you might already have in your existing rhythm of business. Remember, we’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather, incorporate OKRs into your existing workflow.

- Annual strategic planning 
- Quarterly reviews with senior leadership 
- Monthly scorecard review 

**How OKRs help**

- Engage key stakeholders early in the planning process and establish ownership and accountability of critical goals   
- Identify macro dependencies, both vertically and horizontally across the organization, to ensure that key projects can be achieved without blockers   
- Surface early constraints such as budget, bandwidth, and priorities to allow for planning and execution 
- Keep senior leadership informed on overall progression of goals at the org level 
- Ensure ongoing, consistent accountability to avoid a “set it and forget it” mentality 

**Key milestone**

- Dashboard report for senior leadership to provide transparency and highlight opportunity and risk

## How to run your Leadership Strategy meetings

Imagine you’re a large organization who primarily uses annual strategic planning today, and historically checked in on progress against your scorecard quarterly. 

As you incorporate OKRs into your business rhythms, you would still keep your annual planning cadence, but move towards monthly check-ins, using dashboards within Viva Goals to track progress. 

### Annual Planning 

Annual planning is the most critical piece in setting up your company for success. With a concrete plan, you'll gain a clear idea of where your organization is headed, how you'll define success, and how you'll achieve your organization's biggest priorities. Annual planning consists of three phases. 

1. **One to three months before the new year** 
     <br> Senior-level leadership meets and discusses annual company goals. In this phase, you should ask the following questions: 
    - Which goals do we want to roll over for the new year? 
    - What did we learn from the goals we reached this year, and from those we didn't reach? 
    - What are our current gaps and problem areas? This should include market and industry, cross-functionality, team ability, and resourcing. 

2. **One month before the new year**
    <br>Senior leadership should communicate with team leaders about annual company-level goals and how those align with the team's quarterly goals. Discussion with team leaders ensures that every team understands the priorities for the upcoming year.

    In this phase, you should accomplish the following things: 
    -  Make sure team leaders understand the company mission, and vision and how those tie to the company-wide OKRs 
    - Give team leaders a chance to deliver feedback on company-wide OKRs 
    - Train team leaders on OKR best practices and Viva Goals

3. **First week of the new year**  
    Senior leadership shares the organizational OKRs with the entire company, and schedules regular check-ins, monthly, and quarterly reviews. 

### Monthly or Quarterly Strategic Meetings 

While annual planning sets the north star for the year, monthly or quarterly strategic meetings ensure members of the senior leadership team stay on track. 

The dashboard for this meeting should have two elements: 

1. Text boxes with qualitative information: 
    - Meeting agenda 
    - List of major initiatives or “big rocks” 
    - What went well / completed items 
    - Key learnings and opportunities to improve 
    - Risks, mitigation, and where help is needed 

2. OKR widgets with quantitative information 
    - Objectives and key results for this time period showing exact progress against goals 

## How to create and customize dashboards within Viva Goals
