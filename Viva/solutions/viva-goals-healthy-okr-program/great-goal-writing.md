# Guide to great goal writing

In the vast realm of business, where leaders look to align employees with the company’s mission and purpose, the art of setting goals becomes the cornerstone of success. 

This guide provides an overview of what makes a goal great and best practices for writing goals that inspire action and deliver results. 

## What are goals and why are they important? 

Simply put, great business goals provide the roadmap for achieving amazing business results.  

Whether that means earning record revenues or building a thriving team culture, the goals you set will help you fulfill the mission and purpose of your organization. 

Conversely, lacking clear goals has been shown to be a top barrier to productivity, with both businesses and employees paying the price. Without a source of truth for business goals, organizations lack a sense of focus built on prioritization, alignment to the most important needs of the business, and insight into progress. This results in leaders and employees being ill equipped to succeed in today’s uncertain business climate.    

That’s why setting great goals is critically important – but it doesn’t have to be that difficult. 

We like to break down a great goal into three parts: 

1. **An ambitious, aspirational target to aim for**

    Start with an ambitious goal you’d like to achieve, doing your best to make it clear, concise, and aspirational so that others can easily articulate it and share your vision. Picture it as a slogan that would fit on a t-shirt.

1. **Tied to measurable outcomes**

    Having measurable metrics is critical, allowing you to track and monitor progress along the way so that you know if you’re on track or need to make adjustments. At any point you should be able to answer the question, am I on track to achieve my goal or not? 

1. **With action connected to the work of your team**

    Connecting the results you want to achieve to the actions that need to be done ensures that your goals don’t become “set it and forget it.” Team members should come to work each week and be able to say “I understand the focused tasks needed to be done in order to achieve our goals. 

## Benefits of effective goal-setting

- **Visibility** 

    Reducing silos, surfacing dependencies, and avoiding roadblocks: By getting all goals into one centralized source of truth, leadership has a line of sight into what teams are working on and progress being made; employees and teams have clearly defined ownership of core outcomes across the organization, creating a culture of accountability. 

- **Focus** 

    Prioritizing the most important goals: Leaders and employees are now keeping goals top-of-mind by seeing them in the natural flow of work with Microsoft Teams and Slack integrations. 

- **Alignment** 

    Aligning to purpose at the highest levels of the organization: More focused teams with clear goals can find better alignment with one another to achieve outcomes more efficiently. 

- **Adaptability** 

    Reducing friction: Regular check-ins and updates on progress mean teams can make faster and better decisions based on dynamic real-time data through data and project management integrations. 

- **Growth** 

    Setting stretch goals and reaching beyond: With clear goals, lock-step alignment, and regular reflection, businesses begin to develop a culture of growth mindset and rapid business growth. 

## How do goals change at various levels within my business? 

From the visionary ambitions of top executives to the targeted objectives of frontline teams, the type of goals you set will vary as you cascade throughout an organization. 

- **Organizational Leadership level**

    At the senior leadership level, goals tend to be longer term, broader, and are the most aspirational. For example, a goal centered on team culture might be, “Build a world class company culture filled with rock star employees.”

- **Group / Department level** 

    At the group or department level, goals start to become more focused. Collaboration is an important factor to prevent silos and ensure alignment is happening across the organization. A sample goal at this level might be, “Improve our DEI commitment to better reflect the local community that we serve.” 

- **Team level**

    At the team level, goals remain aspirational but are the most actionable in nature. One of the measurable outcomes around the DEI goal might be, “Improve the ratio of female applicants from 20% to 30%” 

- **Individual level**

    At the individual level, team members might be a goal owner that is the directly responsible individual (DRI) whose job it's to monitor and check in team goals. In this case, they would track the ratio of female applicants. Or, individual team members might be stakeholders, and help carry out the actionable initiatives of the team, such as “Deliver 6 recruitment workshops to female audiences at universities in three new geographic regions.” 

> [!NOTE]
> All of the roles discussed are in support of transparent business goals. A purely individual goal by a single team member such as “get promoted from manager to senior manager” would fall under private goals with their manager or human resources team.

## Goal setting pitfalls and best practices 

### Pitfall: Setting too many goals 

**Best practice**: Sharpen focus by limiting the number of goals to 3-5

It’s been said, “If everything is important, then nothing is.” A major pitfall that companies fall into again and again when setting goals isn’t actually not doing enough, but rather, trying to do too much. 

Limiting the number of goals set each quarter actually improves performance, allowing you to focus on the most important things to get done, and being able to lower the priority of everything else. For that reason, setting just 3-5 goals per team is the optimal amount. 

### Pitfall: Setting “business as usual” goals that are too safe 

**Best practice**: Set aspirational stretch goals

A truly aspirational goal is one where you feel that you might only have a 50/50 chance of fully achieving it. And yes, no one likes to be in a status meeting and seeing their goal status “in the red.” But in order to achieve great results, it’s important to push past that and set goals that stretch to what is possible. 

### Pitfall: A “set it and forget it” approach to goals 

**Best practice**: Conduct frequent check-ins to monitor goal progress and make adjustments

The end of a goal-setting planning session can feel great. Targets are set, everyone is on the same page, and the future looks amazing. But it’s the day-to-day execution that leads to results. In order to do that, consistent check-ins on progress are required to monitor results. Even if it's only every two weeks, getting feedback drives accountability and keep teams on track. 

### Pitfall: Making things too complicated 

**Best practice**: Start where you are 

If you ask a photographer “What is the best camera?”, a common answer is “the one you have with you,” which explains the overwhelming popularity of mobile phone cameras and photo sharing apps over more complicated and bulky DSLRs.  

The same can be said for goal-setting systems. While Viva Goals is based on the OKR framework, if your organization already has goals written, don't feel like you have to throw them out and start over in order to adhere to a strict formula. Instead, start where you are, and you can make small tweaks to be more aspirational and measurable as you go.  

Additionally, you can incorporate goal setting into your existing flow of work. If you already have data related to your goals in Excel, ADO, Jira, Salesforce, or other systems, you can integrate that with Viva Goals in just a few select. 

Likewise for communication. Don’t seek to create new meetings to discuss goals, but rather, carve out a small amount of time to discuss goals within existing meetings.

### Pitfall: Goals don’t have measurable outcomes (or measure the wrong thing) 

**Best practice**: Choose the right metrics 

Tracking and monitoring your goals gives you insight and can help you pivot when needed, but only if you set the right metrics. Vague outcomes such as "increase our marketing reach" or "improve customer service" make it difficult	to know if progress has been made.  

Let's say you want to improve company culture, so you have a metric of "increase attendance at all-hands meetings."  

- First, ask yourself, is this data available? Is there a record of the "before" state of how many people attend so you can improve on that number? 

- Next, how easy is it to get this data? If you have a 300 person hybrid team where some meet in person and some online, will you need someone to manually count attendees? 

- Will attendance give you the feedback you’re seeking? Would a survey showing if attendees gain value from the meeting be a better indicator of success? 

- Lastly, is this truly a metric that moves the needle? Surely attendance at company events is important, but if you could only set and achieve three goals this quarter, is there something else that would have a greater impact? That’s what we mean about choosing the right metrics.

### Pitfall: Immediately move from one goal to the next 

**Best practice**: Celebrate success!  

The pace of business moves quickly and is constantly changing. Once a goal setting rhythm of business has been established, it’s easy to move from one time period to the next, whether goals were reached or not. However, it’s important to reflect on what went wrong, how things could be improved, and equally as important – celebrate significant wins. 

## Types of Goal Setting Frameworks 

Goal setting frameworks serve as powerful tools to structure and guide the process of setting and achieving goals. Here are just a few of the commonly recognized types of goal setting frameworks: 

### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) 

The OKR framework is a proven goal-setting method for creating alignment, focus and an engaged work culture to drive business outcomes. In fact, OKRs are the #1 most commonly used goal-setting framework at enterprise organizations, and leaders that use OKRs are 35% more likely to report having focused teams who are clear on their goals and impact (Forrester Research).  

The three elements of OKRs match up directly with the three core elements of a goal we defined above: 

1. An ambitious, aspirational target to aim for (Objectives) 
1. Tied to measurable outcomes (Key Results) 
1. With action connected to the work of your team (Initiatives)

### SMART Goals 

The SMART framework emphasizes setting goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. It provides a structured approach to ensure goals are well-defined and have clear parameters for success. 

### Balanced Scorecard (BSC)  

Balanced scorecard is a goal-setting and performance management system that provides a comprehensive view of organizational performance. It incorporates four key perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth.  

By considering a range of metrics across these perspectives, the BSC aims to align goals and measure success in a balanced and holistic manner, going beyond financial measures to capture factors crucial for long-term success. 

### 4DX (four Disciplines of Execution)  

The 4DX framework is a goal-setting and execution methodology that helps organizations achieve breakthrough results. It involves focusing on a few wildly important goals (WIGs), identifying specific actions (lead measures), tracking progress on a visible scoreboard, and fostering accountability through regular meetings.

## Summary

Great business goals provide the roadmap for achieving amazing business results, and can be broken down into three main components: An ambitious, aspirational target to aim for, tied to measurable outcomes, with action connected to the work of your team. 

There are five main benefits of effective goal-setting, including Visibility, Focus, Alignment, Adaptability, and Growth. And while there are some pitfalls along the way for those new to goal setting (such as setting too many goals), there are an equal number of best practices to offset them (staying focused by limiting the number of goals to 3-5). 

Lastly, there are several goal setting frameworks that serve as powerful tools to structure and guide the process of setting and achieving goals, with the most popular being Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).
