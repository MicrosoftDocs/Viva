# How to turn good OKRs to great OKRs

The practice of writing great OKRs emphasizes progress over perfection. Getting started, even with "less than perfect" OKRs, is the most important thing.  

That said, a common question we get from organizations building out their goal-setting program is: 

“How do I know if my OKRs are any good? How do I turn good OKRs into great OKRs?” 

We love the mindset of continuous improvement, so offer the following tips. 

## How to turn good OKRs to great OKRs

### Checklist of questions to ask as you write your OKRs

**Objectives**

- What is the most important area of our business that we need to focus on?  
- Why does that matter for us now?  
- How would we write it into a statement that inspires our team? 

**Key Results**

- What metric would let us know that we were successful?  
- Do we currently measure that metric?  
- What is our target & baseline?  

### Checklist of questions to ask as you review your OKRs

- Do our OKRs go beyond “business as usual” to strive for ambitious outcomes and reaching for what’s possible?  
- Have we limited both Objectives and the Key Results below them to 3-5 at most?  
- Can our team directly impact the results or are we reliant on stakeholders? If the latter, can we make it a shared OKR? 
- Do we have the right owners identified who will feel accountability for driving progress?
- Will we be able to see progress on each Key Result in the current time frame? 
- Have we asked coworkers to review our OKRs to make sure they're clear, concise, and measurable from an outsider's perspective?

### Checklist of questions to ask as you enter OKRs into Viva Goals

- Have we set up integrations to a single source of truth where possible to enable faster and better decision making based on dynamic real-time data and insights?  
- Have we aligned our goals from the top down, bottom up, and across teams to ensure everyone is driving towards the same purpose, across the organization?  
- Are our OKRs public for all team members to see in order to create accountability and surface dependencies and roadblocks? 

### Necessary and sufficient test

Using the “necessary and sufficient” test to review your OKRs: 

In looking at an OKR, ask yourself, "Are all these Key Results necessary to achieve my Objective?" 

- If the answer is yes, then it passes the necessary test. 
- If the answer is no, then remove what isn't needed. 

Next, ask yourself, "Will accomplishing my Key Results be sufficient enough to achieve my Objective?" 

- If yes, then it passes the sufficient test and you're good to go. 
- If no, then modify existing Key Results to make them stronger, and add any Key Results to achieve your Objective. 

## Follow the formula

This OKR example shows you how to take your OKRs from good to great. 

Let’s start with the first draft of a broad objective: 

**Good Objective: Make more money outside the United States**

While most businesses do need to make money, this objective could be better. It’s too vague to be actionable, aspirational, or meaningful, and it doesn’t follow our formula. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verb + what you’re going to do + so that / in order to

**Great: Expand into the Latin America market in order to increase product market share**

This objective is clearer, meaningful, follows the formula, and drives the business forward.

Now let’s look at three Key Results that span across Sales and Marketing.  

1. Increase new product sales from $100k to $1.5m (Sales)  
1. Increase social media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing)
1. Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing)

**Good Key Results:** These key results are good, since they're focused, measurable, and generally follow the formula.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verb + what you’re going to track / count + from x to y

**Great Key Results:** In taking a step back, we realize we’re missing a stakeholder – the product team. So we add a Key Result around growing a Spanish language version of our product. 

1. Increase new product sales from $100k to $1.5m (Sales)  
1. Increase social media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing)  
1. Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing) 
1. Increase users of Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product)

## Perform the necessary and sufficient test

**Good Key Results:** The four that we have are solid.  

**Great Key Results:** However, to further finalize our OKRs, we apply the Necessary and Sufficient Test, which results in us removing one KR, and adding another one. 

**"Are all these Key Results *necessary* to achieve my Objective?"**

When we think hard, we realize that increasing our social media views isn't necessary to meeting our Objective, so let’s remove that one. 

1. Increase new product sales from $100k to $ 1.5 m (Sales)
1. ~~ Increase social media views from 5,000 to 15,000 (Marketing)~~ 
1. Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing) 
1. Increase users of Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product) 

**"Will accomplishing my Key Results be *sufficient* enough to achieve my Objective?"**

What you realize is that you won’t be able to sufficiently achieve your goal without adding more spanish-speaking sales reps. So let’s add that final Key Result. 

1. Increase new product sales from $100k to $ 1.5 m (Sales)  
1. Increase qualified leads via web form from 50 to 3,000 (Marketing) 
1. Increase users of Spanish language app from 0 to 10,000 (Product) 
1. **Increase bilingual sales staff from 2 to 5 (People)**

**Good OKR:** We now have a fantastic Objective, with four Key Results. 

**Great OKR:** Lastly, we need to make sure our team is taking action. To do so, we add an Initiative for the product team, since they haven’t yet launched the Spanish language app. 

  **Initiative: Launch Spanish language version of our app for Android and iOS**

## Summary

As you can see, through several iterations, we took a good OKR with a vague objective, and turned it into a great one, with an inspirational objective, measurable key results, and an action-focused Initiative.
