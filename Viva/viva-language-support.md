# Microsoft Viva language support
  
The Microsoft Viva user interface is supported in several languages depending on the module. This article details which languages are currently supported in the different Viva modules.


## Viva Amplify
Viva Amplify campaigns can be created in most of the major languages supported by Microsoft 365. Learn which [languages are supported by Viva Amplify](/viva/amplify/viva-amplify-supported-languages).

## Viva Connections
Viva Connections is available in most major languages used in Microsoft 365. 

Broadly, Viva Connections mobile has four components that influence the end userâ€™s overall language experience - the Viva Connections Dashboard, Feed, Resources, and the Teams mobile app.

See all of the [available languages](/viva/connections/viva-connections-language#available-languages) and learn how to [set up the Viva Connections experience in a specific language](/viva/connections/viva-connections-language).

## Viva Engage
Viva Engage supports the same languages as Yammer on the web. See [which languages Yammer is available in](https://support.microsoft.com/office/14dd5886-d48d-4d6d-a583-4273a2538540). Viva Engage will use the language set for Microsoft Teams. If that language is not supported, Viva Engage will fall back to English.

## Viva Glint
English is the default language for all Viva Glint programs, but you can send survey and email communications to your employees in their preferred language. Currently Viva Glint supports over 70 language translations for standard content. Viva Glint admins can export all program content into .csv and .xlsx format. Exporting a file that includes English and all relevant translations allows users to review, add or edit translations in one place.

## Viva Learning
Viva Learning adapts to your organization's Microsoft 365 language preferences. This means that you'll have Viva Learning in the same language that you have Microsoft Teams. However, Viva Learning doesn't currently support right-to-left languages.

## Viva Pulse
Viva Pulse supports 40 language translations for standard content and is available in most major languages used in Microsoft 365.

Content added by users (such as when a feedback author adds or edits a question or when a feedback provider enters a response for an open-ended question) is displayed in the language in which it was entered.
