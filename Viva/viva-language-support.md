# Microsoft Viva language support
  
The Microsoft Viva user interface is supported in several languages depending on the module. This article details which languages are currently supported in Viva Connections, Viva Learning, Viva Topics, and Viva Insights.


## Viva Connections
Viva Connections is available in most major languages used in Microsoft 365. 

Broadly, Viva Connections mobile has four components that influence the end userâ€™s overall language experience - the Viva Connections Dashboard, Feed, Resources, and the Teams mobile app.

See all of the [available languages](/viva/connections/viva-connections-language#available-languages) and learn how to [set up the Viva Connections experience in a specific language](/viva/connections/viva-connections-language).



## Viva Learning
Viva Learning adapts to your organization's Microsoft 365 language preferences. This means that you'll have Viva Learning in the same language that you have Microsoft Teams. However, Viva Learning doesn't currently support right-to-left languages.

Learn more about [language support for Viva Learning](/viva/learning/viva-learning-supported-languages).


## Viva Insights 

<!--**Teams app + Personal**-->

Personal insights in Viva Insights are available in most of the [same languages as Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-languages-is-office-available-in-26d30382-9fba-45dd-bf55-02ab03e2a7ec).

Briefing emails aren't supported in all languages listed above. See which languages are supported in [Briefing languages](/viva/insights/personal/briefing/be-languages).

## Viva Engage

Viva Engage will use the language set for Microsoft Teams. If that language is not supported, Viva Engage will fall back to English.
