# Install Viva Sales from AppSource

## Microsoft Outlook

1.  Sign in to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/home).

2.  Search for **Viva Sales for Microsoft Outlook**.
    
3.  In the tile for the app in search results, select **Get it now**.

4.  If you're asked to confirm your details to continue, do so, and then select **Get it now** again.  
    The AppSource window closes. You'll complete the remaining steps in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

5.  In the **Configuration** step, verify the information, and then select **Next**.

6.  In the **Users** step, select the users or groups who will have access to the add-in, and then select **Next**.

7.  In the **Deployment (Permissions)** step, read the app permissions and capabilities, select **Accept permissions**, and then select **Next**.

8.  In the **Deployment (Finish)** step, select **Finish deployment**.

9.  When the deployment is complete, select **Done**.

Allow up to 24 hours for Viva Sales to appear in users' Outlook ribbon.

## Microsoft Teams

If you install the Viva Sales app for Teams from AppSource, you'll install it to your personal scope only, not for your users. We recommend you to install the Viva Sales app for your users from Microsoft 365 admin center.
