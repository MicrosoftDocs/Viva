# Microsoft Viva overview

Microsoft Viva is an integrated employee experience platform built within Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams that gives you the ability to support connection, insight, purpose, and growth in your organization using your existing infrastructure.

Viva is easily customizable and extensible, accessible from anywhere you work, and supports several partner integrations to give you access to industry-leading apps in the natural flow of work.

Viva is an open and extensible platform. Partners and developers can use toolkits and APIs for supported Viva apps. To find out more, see the [Microsoft Viva Developer Page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/viva).

As an integrated experience, administrators can use the centralized Microsoft 365 admin center experience to access guided setups for deploying Viva. [Learn how to set up Microsoft Viva](/viva/setup-microsoft-viva).
