#### Viva Amplify
Viva Amplify centralizes campaign management, publishing, and reporting so corporate communicators can reach and engage all employees meaningfully. By using multi-channel publishing, communicators can reach employees across channels such as Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint. Users can create and manage organization-wide campaigns to help inform organizations, create alignment, and inspire action – all from one place. Employees continue to see relevant messages in their existing preferred channels.

#### Viva Engage
Brings people together across the organization to connect with leaders, coworkers, and communities. It can also help people crowdsource answers and ideas, share their work and experience, and find belonging at work. The Viva Engage app integrates these experiences into Microsoft Teams and introduces new features including storyline and stories. These new features will also appear in the Viva Engage web, desktop and mobile apps, so no matter where an employee visits, they’ll see the same content and feature set.
