# Microsoft Viva overview

With the growth in hybrid work, it is more important than ever to connect employees with an integrated employee experience that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights into the flow of work.

Viva is easily customizable and extensible, accessible from anywhere you work, and integrates with tools you already use. It also supports several partner integrations to give you access to industry-leading apps in the natural flow of work.

Viva is an open and extensible platform. Soon, partners and developers will be able to use toolkits and APIs for each of the four modules. The [Viva Connections toolkit](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/overview-viva-connections) is available now, and coming soon are APIs for Viva Insights and Viva Learning as well as content support for Viva Topics. To find out more, see the [Microsoft Viva Developer Page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/viva).

As an integrated experience, administrators can use the centralized Microsoft 365 admin center experience to access guided setups for deploying Viva. [Learn how to set up Microsoft Viva](/viva/setup-microsoft-viva).

Learn which Microsoft Viva features are available across Microsoft 365 plans in the [Microsoft Viva service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-viva-service-description).

### Viva Topics: Knowledge and expertise
Viva Topics applies AI to automatically organize content and expertise across your systems and teams into related topics, like projects, products, processes, and customers. That content appears as topic pages and topic centers—created and updated by AI—that enable experts to cultivate and share knowledge with wiki-like simplicity. It also pops up as topic cards that deliver knowledge across Outlook, SharePoint, and Office.
