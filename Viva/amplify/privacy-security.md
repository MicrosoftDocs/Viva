# Privacy and security in Microsoft Viva Amplify

Microsoft Viva Amplify follows standard Microsoft 365 privacy and security protocols. If your organization is using SharePoint, Amplify will use the same privacy and security standards.

Viva Amplify campaigns are set as private by default because campaigns are designed to be a private collaborative space for campaign team members to work and build their communications. Changing this setting is not recommended.
