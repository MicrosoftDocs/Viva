# Privacy and security in Microsoft Viva Amplify

If your organization is using SharePoint, Amplify will use the same privacy and security standards.

## Security

Microsoft Viva Amplify follows Microsoft Viva security standards. [Learn more about security in Microsoft Viva](../viva-security.md).

## Privacy

Viva Amplify campaigns are set as private by default because campaigns are designed to be a private collaborative space for campaign team members to work and build their communications. Changing this setting isn't recommended.

[Learn more about privacy in Microsoft Viva](../viva-privacy.md).

## How Viva Amplify stores Approvals data

Viva Amplify approval stores data in Dataverse tables following the Power Platform guidelines and policies for data storage. Approvals created using templates may store some data outside the local region. However, this isn't applicable for approvals created in Viva Amplify because Viva Amplify approvals don't use templates. As a result, Viva Amplify approvals data is always stored in the local region.
