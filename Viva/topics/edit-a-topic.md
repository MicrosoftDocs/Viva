# Edit an existing topic in Microsoft Viva Topics 

</br>

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4LA4n]  

</br>

In Viva Topics, you can edit an existing topic. You might need to do this if you want to correct or add additional information to an existing topic page. 

> [!Note] 
> While information in a topic that is gathered by AI is [security trimmed](topic-experiences-security-trimming.md), the topic description and people information that you manually add when editing an existing topic is visible to all users who have permissions to view topics. 

## Requirements to edit a topic

To edit an existing topic, you need to:
- Have a Viva Topics license.
- Have permissions to [create or edit topics](./topic-experiences-user-permissions.md). Knowledge admins can give users this permission in the Viva Topics topic permissions settings. 

> [!Note] 
> Users who have permission to manage topics in the topic center (knowledge managers) already have permissions to create and edit topics.

## How to edit a topic page

Users who have the *Who can create or edit topics* permission can edit a topic by opening the topic page from a topic highlight, and then selecting the **Edit** button on the top right of the topic page. The topic page can also be opened from the topic center home page where you can find all the topics that you have a connection to.

### To edit a topic page

1. On the topic page, select **Edit**. This lets you make changes as needed to the topic page.

    You can confirm a suggested type by selecting the check mark next to the type listed in the **suggested** row. To remove a confirmed type, select the X mark on the type to be removed.

    You can also choose to display a type badge on the topic's page and card based on the type first listed in the **confirmed**.

    ![Screenshot showing the topic type badge.](../media/knowledge-management/types-display-badge.png)

    To change the type badge, drag and drop the type you'd like to see displayed to the first position in the section. Only one topic type badge is available per topic.

5. In the **Pinned people** section, you can "pin" a person to show them as having a connection the topic (for example, an owner of a connected resource). Begin by typing their name or email address in the **Add a new user** box, and then selecting the user you want to add from the search results. You can also "unpin" them by selecting the **Remove from list** icon on the user card.

    You can use the search function in the resource picker to search for a file or page. To use the search, select **Add**. The resource picker will open and you can select the search option to search for a file or page.

7. The **Suggested files and pages** section shows files and pages that AI suggests to be associated to the topic.
