# Analytics for Microsoft Viva Topics

Insights are available for Viva Topics in the Microsoft 365 admin center. You need to be a SharePoint admin and a Groups admin to see these reports.

To access Viva Topics insights
1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, expand **Settings** and select **Search & intelligence**.
1. On the **Insights** tab, select **Viva Topics**.

## Topics overview

The **Topics overview** section provides a look at topic visibility in your organization.

The information in this section is based on the time period that you select. The changes from the last time period appear next to each metric. If the time period selected is larger than when data was first available, the delta is collected from a starting point of 0.
