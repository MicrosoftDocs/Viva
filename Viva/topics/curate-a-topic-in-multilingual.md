# Curate  Multilingual topics in Microsoft Viva Topics

The Multilingual feature in Viva Topics allows you to curate and edit a topic page in English, French, German, and Spanish.

> [!Note] 
> A topic page must be created and curated in the tenant's default language before it can be curated to a different language using the Multilingual feature in Viva Topics. 

## Curate Multilingual content into a topic page

To curate a multilingual topic page, open a topic page, and select **Multilingual** on the upper-left of the topic page. The topic page can also be opened from the topic center home page or from a topic highlight in your tenant.
