# Curate Multilingual topics in Microsoft Viva Topics

The Multilingual feature in Viva Topics allows you to curate and edit a topic page in English, French, German, and Spanish.

> [!Note] 
> A topic page must be created and curated in the tenant's default language before it can be curated to a different language using the Multilingual feature in Viva Topics 

## Curate Multilingual content into a topic page

To curate a multilingual topic page, open a topic page, and select **Multilingual** on the upper-left of the topic page. The topic page can also be opened from the topic center home page or from a topic highlight in your tenant.

4. Confirm or edit the topic name on the Multilingual topic page. If the topic name is the same in the new language, keep the current topic name.

> [!Note] 
> When editing the Multilingual page, there are fields you can only edit in the default language topic page. Fields available to edit in the default language topic page include: Confirmed people, Pinned files and pages, Related sites, and Related topics.
   To edit these fields, save or publish your changes on the Multilingual topic page and visit the topic's default language page and continue editing if needed.

## View a published Multilingual topic page
To view a published Multilingual topic page, select a language option on the upper-right language menu of the topic page.

## Language settings
The topic user's preferred language in their tenant will determine the language in which the Viva Topics metadata will be presented on a topic card, topic answer, topic picker, and other Viva Topics tools. If the preferred language is Spanish, the topic contributor will be presented with Spanish content.

Languages can be changed or updated through settings in the apps.
