# My organization

You can view leader insights in **My organization** within the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams. As a business leader, these insights give you a snapshot of how your company is doing. The insights include company-wide outcomes and leading indicators for each outcome, which help you see why it's important to pay attention to that outcome:

While you can also see these outcomes and their related best practices in Viva Insights in Workplace Analytics, it's advantageous to find them in Teams. That's because you're already using Teams for communicating during remote work, namely for meeting, for sharing files, and for sending IMs to employees and other leaders.

## Data privacy

For information about data privacy and GDPR compliance in the Viva Insights app, see [Privacy and data protection](../privacy/data-protection-intro.md).

## Admin tasks

For access to **My organization**, your admin must assign you the role of _Insights Business Leader_ for Viva Insights. Refer your admin to [Assign roles](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md) for details.

Your admin also needs to install and set up the Viva Insights app in Teams for the organization. See [Admin tasks](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-admin-tasks.md) for details.

## Install, pin, and configure the app

After your admin completes the [Admin tasks](#admin-tasks), your setup for **My organization** is the same as for [Personal insights](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app.md) in the Viva Insights app. See the following to install, pin, and configure the app in Teams:

* [Install and pin the app](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md)
* [Configure the app](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-settings.md)
