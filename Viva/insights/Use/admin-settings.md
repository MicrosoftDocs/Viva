# Leader and manager settings

As the Microsoft Viva Insights Administrator, you can use **Leader & manager settings** to configure the following.

* **Privacy settings** - Applies exclusively to the outcome data that leaders see in the Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams. Use the **Tenant minimum group size** setting to set the minimum number of people in a group, which must be at least five, before **Insights Business Leaders** can see any data in **My organization**.
* **Manager settings** - Enable all or specific people managers to see team insights on the **My team** page within Viva Insights in Teams. For details, see [Manager settings](manager-settings.md).

**Owner** – Viva Insights Administrators can access these settings. For details, see [Assign roles](../setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins.md).
