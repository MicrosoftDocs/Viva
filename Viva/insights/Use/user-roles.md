# Roles in Viva Insights

People need the correct level of access to specific product areas to perform their required tasks. The roles are distinct in their assigned responsibilities and access permissions.

Each role only gives access to actions, pages, dashboards, and data that correspond with that role. Roles are assigned independently, are non-cumulative, and do not roll up.

The _Insights Administrator_ and the legacy _Workplace Analytics admin_ are interchangeable. Both have access to the same features and functions and share the same responsibilities and tasks for Viva insights.

The _Analyst (Limited Access)_ and _Program Manager_ roles that are listed in the following tables, are only applicable to features available within the advanced insights app for licenses assigned before October 2021. For those who are assigned licenses and the Insights Business Leader roles starting in October 2021, they can only access their applicable insights within the Viva Insights app.

### Access to resources

In Azure Active Directory, you can assign access rights to users by assigning roles to them. For general information on accessing resources, and for information on the specific methods of role assignment in Azure AD, see [Related topics](#related-topics).

## Aspects of role assignment

### How many assignees

The size of your organization and your requirements for managing organizational data determine the number of people to whom you assign specific roles for Viva Insights. The number of analysts should be as many as your organization requires to perform data analysis. Viva Insights imposes no limit on the number of role assignments.

### Multiple roles for one person

You can assign multiple roles to one person. It's up to your organization to choose who is assigned which role or roles. For example:

* One person can be both a Microsoft 365 admin and a Viva Insights Administrator.
* One person can be both a Viva Insights Administrator and an Analyst. However, it is a best practice to assign the admin and analyst roles to different people to prevent any misuse of or external linking of organizational data with collaboration metrics.

In the Azure Portal, you can assign multiple roles to one account, but you can assign only one role at a time. In the Azure portal, add the first role, choose **Select**, return to the user list, and then select the same account again to choose the next role for that account. Note that role assignment is performed in the Azure Portal and not in the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 dashboard.
