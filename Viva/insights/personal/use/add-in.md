# Viva Insights Outlook add-in

_**Applies to**: Microsoft Viva Insights elements are available in varying levels to users of different Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft 365 plans. See [Plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for details. Also see [How do I find my plan?](../overview/mya-faq.md#q1-how-can-i-find-out-what-my-plan-is)_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar? Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Microsoft Viva Insights Outlook add-in provides insights that can help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done during your workday.

This add-in is an extension of your Microsoft Outlook experience and works within Outlook to help you gain focus time, maintain your work relationships, plan time away from work, and improve your overall work-life balance.

## Privacy by design

This Outlook add-in preserves all the data-subject rights afforded by GDPR. The insights you see in the add-in are only available to you. They are computed as needed, from your email and meeting information, and are never stored outside your mailbox.

Additionally, the add-in begins processing data for insights only after the first time you open it. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/CloudServices/office365/default.aspx) about how Microsoft protects your privacy.

## How to see the add-in

Before you can use the Viva Insights Outlook add-in, be sure that the following prerequisites are in place:

* Have an applicable [Microsoft 365 plan](../overview/plans-environments.md) and let at least 24 hours elapse since you were granted that license.
* Have a valid mailbox. This cannot be a shared mailbox or even a shared mailbox that was converted into a user mailbox. It must be a user mailbox from the start. We recommended that you [provision a new user mailbox](/exchange/recipients/create-user-mailboxes#create-user-mailboxes), if necessary.
* Have the following in place:

  * Your computer has Microsoft Outlook version 1705 (build 8201.2102) or higher for Windows, or version 15.39.1010 or later for Mac.
  * Add-in commands are enabled for the Outlook add-in. For details, see [Add-in commands for Outlook](/outlook/add-ins/add-in-commands-for-outlook).
  * Internet Explorer version 10 or 11 is installed on your computer.  

* The admin enables the add-in by default in the Exchange admin center. If your admin sets the deployment status as "Optionally, disabled by default," you can manually add the Viva Insights Outlook add-in yourself from the Microsoft Store Add-ins.

>[!Note]
>The Viva Insights Outlook add-in is not available on mobile devices.

Open the Viva Insights Outlook add-in in one of the programs listed under [Open the Viva Insights add-in](#open-the-add-in), namely [Windows Outlook desktop](#windows-outlook-desktop), [Outlook on the web](#outlook-on-the-web), or [Mac Outlook desktop](#mac-outlook-desktop).

* Select an email. In Outlook, you can do this in one of the following ways:

  1. Open the email in a new window.
  2. With the [Outlook Reading Pane](https://support.office.com/article/use-and-configure-the-reading-pane-to-preview-messages-2fd687ed-7fc4-4ae3-8eab-9f9b8c6d53f0) open, view the email in the Reading Pane.
