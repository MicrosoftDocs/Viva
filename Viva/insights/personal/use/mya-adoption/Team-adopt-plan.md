# Team Adoption plan

The ideal program team is comprised of the following members:

* [Executive sponsor](Team-adopt-plan.md#executive-sponsor)
* [Program manager](Team-adopt-plan.md#program-manager)
* [Change agents](Team-adopt-plan.md#change-agents)
* [Program participants](Team-adopt-plan.md#program-participants)

>[!Note]
>If you are a manager of a small team interested in running this program, focus on the program manager and program participants roles. However, it’s a good idea to inform your manager or an executive sponsor of your admirable effort to help your team build healthier collaboration habits.

### Executive sponsor

The executive sponsor is an influential senior leader who actively promotes the value of developing healthier collaboration habits. This person is committed to endorsing Viva Insights and role modeling healthy work habits. The program participants need to be in this person’s organization.  

The critical responsibilities of the executive sponsor are:

* Participate in defining and communicating the program purpose
* Remove obstacles in the way of the team’s success
* Build excitement for Viva Insights and the change program
* Participate in select program activities
* Serve as a role model for behaviors that you want to promote
* Encourage managers to participate and support the change

### Program manager

The program manager is the main architect of the program and leads implementation. This person can either be the manager of the program participants or another influential and well-respected member of the team who is endorsed by the team’s manager. It is important that this person have strong project management skills. It is also helpful for this person to have previous experience building and running change programs for a group.

The critical responsibilities for the program manager are:

* Secure support from an executive sponsor if the program is not driven from the top
* Identify, train, and manage change agents
* Remove obstacles in the way of the team’s success (See the following note)
* Lead program communications and regularly reinforce the program purpose
* Structure the change program and lead activities
* Lead discussions and idea sharing at check-ins and through collaboration channels
* Champion the Viva Insights product and act as an internal product expert
* Collect, manage, and analyze program feedback and data
* Serve as a role model for behaviors that you want to promote

> [!Note]
> Managers typically focus on incentives to motivate people to change, but often we can do more to facilitate change by removing obstacles than by pushing people into a certain direction (_Nudge_, by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein). For example, if your team’s goal is to add more focus hours but there are no places in your office for quiet work, then designate a few “no-interruption zones” in your space dedicated to focus time.

### Change agents

Change agents are influential team members who help drive program awareness and engagement. They are great communicators, enthusiastic and forward thinking. In many cases, especially if the number of program participants is large, the change agents share responsibilities with the program manager.

The critical responsibilities for the change agents are:

* Amplify program communications
* Build excitement for the program
* Champion Viva Insights and act as internal product experts
* Lead select program activities, such as program check-ins
* Prime discussions and idea sharing through collaboration channels
* Collect and share program feedback with the program manager
* Serve as a role model for behaviors that you want to promote

### Program participants

The program participants are also known as the "team". Without their active and willing participation, change is impossible. While there is no minimum team size, a team comprised of between 10 and 20 participants is ideal. If a team has more than 20 people, consider creating subgroups based on common characteristics and assigning change agents to lead each subgroup.

If you want to select a single subgroup from a larger population, select a team that is central to your network and could inspire other teams to adopt healthier work habits.

The critical responsibilities for the program participants are:

* Learn and actively use Viva Insights
* Attend group meetings – for example, check-ins
* Participate in group discussions and share ideas
* Complete all program surveys
* Provide input to help set goals
* Commit time to learning about behavior change
* Experiment with new behaviors
* Provide feedback on the program
* Help hold teammates accountable for change

The program manager can ask program participants to share their personal collaboration data so that it can be aggregated to a team level to track and measure goal attainment. These materials include instructions for sharing and aggregating data (see [Data sharing](Team-adopt-implement.md#data-sharing)), for the participants who choose to opt in to sharing their Viva Insights data.

Program participants should also be allowed to opt-out of the program if they so choose. If someone does want to opt-out, spend time with that person to understand their concerns, and address those concerns if possible. By identifying resistant individuals early in the program, you can manage them (see [Manage resistance](Team-adopt-implement.md#manage-resistance)) so that they don’t jeopardize program success down the road.

## Structure the program

The program manager needs to define the following:

* [Program duration and dates](Team-adopt-plan.md#program-duration-and-dates)
* [Program components](Team-adopt-plan.md#program-components)
* [A supplementary outcome metric (optional)](Team-adopt-plan.md#a-supplementary-outcome-metric-optional)
* [A control group (optional)](Team-adopt-plan.md#a-control-group-optional)

### Program duration and dates

A program duration of 12 weeks typically gives people adequate time to learn how to use Viva Insights, process new learnings, and experiment with new behaviors. Depending on a team’s needs and where they are in the behavior-change journey, programs might be shorter or longer.

When you select the program’s start and end dates, find a period in which you expect few major disruptions to your team’s calendar. Avoid the holiday season and the summer vacation period since your team is more likely to experience atypical work weeks. Consider your team’s rhythm of business. Avoid running a program during peak workload periods, such as around big or unusual project deadlines.

If Viva Insights is new for your team, wait at least two weeks after the product launches before starting a change program. This gives Viva Insights time to process enough data that all of its features might be used, and this gives program participants enough data to establish meaningful baselines for measuring their progress.

### Program components

These materials provide guidance for using the following six program components:

* [Kickoff meeting](Team-adopt-implement.md#kickoff-meeting)
* [Surveys](Team-adopt-plan.md#create-surveys)
* [Learning modules](Adopt-Learning-modules.md)
* [Check-ins](Team-adopt-implement.md#check-ins)
* [Collaboration channel](Team-adopt-plan.md#establish-a-collaboration-channel)
* [Habit playbooks](adopt-habit-playbooks.md)

While all of these components can improve your program’s success, it is important to design a program that meets the needs of your team. To that end, we recommend that you read the sections about these components, then select the ones that will work best for your team. For example, if your group communicates well by using a collaboration application and you are aiming to minimize the weekly time commitment, you might choose to exclude weekly check-in meetings and rely solely on the application for program discussions.

After you select your program components, determine the right dates and frequency for each component. You can then estimate a weekly time commitment for the team members and include that estimate in your program launch communications.

Consider when you want the executive sponsor to be most visible and active during the program. Include these touch points in your schedule. For example, you might ask the executive sponsor to send an encouraging email or participate in one of the weekly check-in meetings.

The following are examples of program structures and schedules:

**Full program**

**Modified program**

![Modified program schedule example.](../../../images/mya/use/Adopt-teams-3.png)

### A supplementary outcome metric (optional)

In addition to the Viva Insights metrics you will track during the program, you might choose to define a supplementary outcome metric to measure outside of Viva Insights. This metric could include engagement or productivity measures.

The purpose of this metric is to help you understand and communicate the effects of the overall program. For example, using customer satisfaction scores as a supplementary metric can help describe the program experience as: “The team reclaimed four hours of focus time each week. By the end of the program, they were receiving higher customer satisfaction scores on average due to lower stress and higher-quality work/product delivered.”

### A control group (optional)

Establish a control group to measure whether the habit changes that occurred during the program resulted from the program or from other changes in your business. A control group is a group of people similar to your group but who do not participate in the program. If your department has 50 people and you ask only half of the group to actively participate in program activities, you can use the other half of the group as a control group.

To compare changes experienced by the control group to changes experienced by the program team, ask both groups to fill out pre- and post-program surveys. You might also ask them to share Viva Insights data to be aggregated to the group level, if both groups use Viva Insights. Comparing the control results with the program metrics can help you gain a clear understanding of the drivers of change, which in turn helps your efforts to sustain new behaviors after the program ends.

## Develop a communications plan

Successful change programs rely on consistent and transparent communication. Use these communications to address expectations, communicate the plans, and explain how the change will affect employees ([Prosci Best Practices Report](https://www.prosci.com/bookstore/best-practices-in-change-management-2016-edition.html)).

Use these general guidelines when communicating with program participants:

* Focus on the impact of the change on the employee.
* Be clear about what you know now and what you do not know now.
* Let employees know when more information will be available.
* Be clear how employees can provide feedback about the program.

You can use the following example as a template to develop your program-communication plan.

| Program milestone	| Audience | Content | Delivery Mechanism | Communicator | Date |
| -----	| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Launch | Program participants | <li>Program introduction<li>Viva Insights description<li>Program purpose to believe in and expected outcomes<li>High-level overview of program structure<li>Expectations<li>Next steps<li>Program contacts for questions and help | Email | Executive sponsor | Jan. 1 |
| Milestone 2 |   |   |   |   |   |

### Program-launch email

Set your program on the right course with a strong launch email:

* Have the executive sponsor send it.
* Keep it as short as possible. Rely on links to more detailed information when available.
* Personalize the message to draw attention.
* Frame the program as an opportunity for learning and experimentation.
* Provide employees with program contact information and easy feedback channel.
* Include the [Privacy guide](../../overview/privacy-guide-users.md).

This email can include:

* Program introduction
* Viva Insights product overview
* Program purpose statement (see [Conditions for Program Success](Team-adopt-intro.md#conditions-for-program-success))
* High-level overview of program structure
  * Start and end dates
  * Main components
  * Program team
* Immediate action items and next steps
  * Link to the pre-program survey
  * Any additional action items
  * Expected first program event, such as the kick-off meeting
* Preferred method to provide feedback and ask questions throughout the program
* Links to more information on Viva Insights and privacy
  * [Privacy guide](../../overview/privacy-guide-users.md)
  <!--* [Resources for individual adoption](Indiv-adopt-get-started.md)-->
  * Descriptions of [Viva Insights elements](../mya-elements.md)

## Gain support from other teams

Our work culture depends increasingly on multi-teaming, in which people are assigned to multiple projects simultaneously and cross-functionally. If your team works closely with other teams, let these other teams know about the program, and manage their expectations. Otherwise, their demands could create barriers to change. As an added benefit, you might inspire these other teams to embark on their own behavior change journeys.

## Establish a collaboration channel

Adding a social component to your program will help spread new habits. Try to set up a collaboration channel, such as a Microsoft Teams channel, to support your program.

Humans are social animals and we are heavily influenced by what those around us say and do. Social norms, which are the values, actions, and expectations of your group, guide your team’s behaviors  ([EAST Behavioral Change Method](http://38r8om2xjhhl25mw24492dir.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf)). A collaboration channel enables the members of your team to showcase new habits, share experiences (wins and challenges), support one another, make commitments to change, ask product questions, and provide feedback on the program.

The collaboration channel also serves as a great program-management tool. You can provide updates on the program and links to resources, and you can store program materials on the channel to make them easy for program participants to find.

## Create surveys

In addition to the quantitative data that Viva Insights provides, you can use surveys to collect qualitative data before, during, and after your program. Surveys help diagnose collaboration pain points, identify solutions, and understand the results of your program. Aim to keep your survey as short as possible.

For ease of managing the survey, use an application such as Microsoft Forms to distribute the questions and collect results. Consider implementing one or more of the following:

### Pre-program survey

The pre-program survey helps you diagnose your team’s collaboration pain points. Perception often differs from reality, and this survey helps you better understand your team’s actual needs, inform your program goals, and recommend new habits that will resonate with the group. We recommend that you include a link to your pre-program survey in the program-launch email.

### Team norms survey

During your program, you can use Learning modules to experiment with new behaviors. Some of these behaviors will work for your team; others will not. After you try out different behaviors, conduct a team-norms survey to vote on new norms to adopt as a team.

To avoid survey fatigue, bundle the team norms survey with a corresponding [Learning module](Adopt-Learning-modules.md) at the appropriate time in your program schedule. Program participants should complete the survey after they have had time to process the contents of the Learning module and experiment with suggested behaviors.

### Post-program survey

Use the post-program survey to collect additional information on the results of your program, determine whether your program was successful and what the next steps should be to develop heathier work habits. You can also use the post-program survey to manually collect Viva Insights data from participants to measure goal attainment. See [Data sharing](Team-adopt-implement.md#data-sharing).

### Goal-setting survey

A survey can be used to help you set your team goals. To learn more about goal setting and using a survey to help you do so, see [Goal setting](Team-adopt-implement.md#goal-setting).
