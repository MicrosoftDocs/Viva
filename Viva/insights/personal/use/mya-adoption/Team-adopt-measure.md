# Measure

At the end of your program, collect data from program participants in a post-program survey (see [create surveys](Team-adopt-plan.md#create-surveys) and [data sharing](Team-adopt-implement.md#data-sharing) for more information). If you identified an outcome metric, combine that data with the Viva Insights and survey data. If you included a control group in your program, survey and collect any relevant data from your control group as well.

After you’ve collected and analyzed data and feedback, schedule a program-debrief meeting with the program participants to share results, key takeaways, and a proposal for next steps. Next steps could include future Viva Insights change programs, but they should also include the support you intend to provide program participants to sustain the behaviors that helped them to meet their objective (see [Reinforce](Team-adopt-reinforce.md)).  Schedule this meeting for at least an hour, and make time in the agenda for active group discussions.
