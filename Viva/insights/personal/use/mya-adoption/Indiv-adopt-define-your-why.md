# Define your why

People aim to align their actions with their beliefs. If you don’t fully believe in the reasons for behavior change, your motivation to develop new habits will suffer. To position yourself for success, thoughtfully define your “why” for your habit changes. To help you, we recommend that you answer the following questions before you try to change your habits:

* Why is it important for me to change?
* How exactly will things be better for me if I change?
* How will this change make me a better teammate and/or manager?
* What are the risks of not changing?
