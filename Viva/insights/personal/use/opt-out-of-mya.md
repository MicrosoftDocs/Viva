### Access

If you choose to opt out, you lose access to the following items:

* Features
    * All features in the following:
        * Viva Insights app in Teams
        * Viva Insights web app 
        * Microsoft Viva Insights
* Emails
    * Briefing email
        * If you’re subscribed to the daily Briefing email, you’ll continue to receive it without the Viva Insights personal insights content. 
        >[!Important]
        >We've paused sending Briefing emails to make some improvements. You can still access the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](add-in.md) or [Viva Insights app in Teams](../teams/introduction.md) for key functionality until this service resumes. For more information about this change, refer to [Briefing pause](../reference/briefing-pause.md).
    * Semi-monthly Digest email
* Outlook
    * Outlook add-in
    * Schedule send suggestions notifications
        * You can separately opt in to resume schedule send suggestions and receive notifications
* Settings
    * All settings *except* for the following:
        * Opting in and opting out
        * Briefing email
* Focus plans and quiet time
* Virtual commute notifications

If you opt out, you:

* Don’t lose any previously saved settings. If you turn Viva Insights back on later, your current settings reactivate. 
* Continue to have access to Briefing email **(paused; refer to note above)** and privacy settings.  
* Continue to see currently scheduled individual and shared plan events on your calendar unless you delete them.  
* Continue to receive shared plan invites. 
* See a new Home screen on Viva Insights Teams and web app. This Home screen provides the option to opt-in anytime. 
* Aren’t included in any insights that relate to you as an individual. Here are a few examples:
    * Personal insights, like those found in the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web 
    * Flexible query output that relates to you as an individual, like a Person query 
* Continue to be included in aggregated insights and collaboration events. Here are a few examples: 
    * Aggregated insights, like organization insights
    * Flexible query results that draw from the collaboration events, like a Meeting query
* May not see all changes reflected immediately. Some changes, like the Digest email and add-in changes, might take up to a week to take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to a week for your saved changes to take effect.

### If you have multiple accounts

If you have more than one Microsoft 365 account, you might also have more than one subscription to Viva Insights. You can decide which accounts to retain and which ones to opt out of.

Each email account that has a Viva Insights subscription receives regular emails from Microsoft Viva. To opt out of one or more of these subscriptions, first answer the following question:

*Which of my accounts receive emails from Viva Insights subscriptions that I want to opt out of?*

Then, for each account you want to opt out of, sign into Viva Insights. You might choose to use in an in-private browser window so you can stay signed in to your primary account. After you're signed in to the account you want to opt out of, follow the instructions in [To opt out of Viva Insights in the app](#if-i-opt-out-can-i-opt-back-in).

## If I opt out, can I opt back in?

Yes, if you opt yourself out, or if an admin opts you out, you can opt back in any time to regain access to Viva Insights. Follow the steps in [To opt out of Viva Insights in the app](#to-opt-out-of-viva-insights-in-the-app), but in step 3, toggle the switch to **On** instead.
