# Start a guided meditation with Headspace

In the Headspace section of the Briefing email, you can launch a guided meditation to start your day grounded and focused.

Before you can use Headspace, you need access to Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams. See [Discover the Viva Insights app](../teams/viva-teams-app-install.md) for details.

>[!NOTE]
>Headspace is currently available only to you if your Outlook or Exchange Online language is set to English. Additional languages will be supported soon.

## Start a guided meditation

1. In the **Headspace** section of a Briefing email, select **Start meditating** or select the **Play** button to open Headspace within the Viva Insights Teams app (if you're using a computer) or in Teams Mobile (if you're on a mobile device).
