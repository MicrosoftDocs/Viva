# Create plans

If you get the [Adaptive email version](be-overview.md#adaptive-or-html-version), you'll see a **What do you want to set aside time for** section the Briefing email you get on Fridays. This feature helps you enroll in plans that help you improve long-term productivity and wellbeing.

You might see options to book time for the following activities:

* **Focus time** - Schedules up to two-hour blocks of available time on your calendar for uninterrupted focused work. When scheduled, your status shows as "Focusing" and notifications are silenced.
* **Catch up on messages** - Schedules a 30-minute block of time to catch up on email and chats. When scheduled, your status shows as "Busy" during this time each day.
* **Take a break** - Schedules a 15-minute block of time twice a day to disconnect and recharge.
* **Learning** - Schedules up to a two-hour block of time to learn a new skill or for career development.

If you already have time scheduled for one or more of these activities, this section shows a "Booked" status and reports the number of days you have scheduled.

To create a plan through the Briefing email, follow these steps:

1. Select **Book** to reserve time next week to catch up on certain kinds of activities—focus, messages, breaks, or learning.
