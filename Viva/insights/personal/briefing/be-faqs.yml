    questions:
      - question: Who will get the email?
        answer: |
          Everyone in your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 tenant that Exchange Online mailbox is set to a [supported language](be-languages.md) will receive the email (if they have actionable tasks).

      - question: How can I manage who receives the email?  
        answer: |
          The Briefing email is on by default. You can use [PowerShell](be-admin.md) to enable/disable the Briefing email for individual users. You can set the default opt-in or opt-out option at the tenant level in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Users can also individually opt out by selecting the *Unsubscribe* link at the end of the Briefing email.
         
      - question: Does the Briefing email comply with GDPR?
        answer: |
          Yes, Microsoft complies with GDPR requirements when providing the Briefing email.

      - question: Can users see information about other users in the Briefing email?
        answer: |
          The Briefing email only includes existing information that's already available in the user's mailbox. It summarizes documents, emails, and meetings to make it easier for the user to find what's most important for their day ahead. Users cannot see any new information about other users that wasn't already available in their mailboxes.  

  - name: For Briefing users
    questions:
      - question: Who does the email come from?  
        answer: |
          The subject line is "Your daily briefing" and the sender is viva-noreply@microsoft.com with a friendly name of "Microsoft Viva."

      - question: How does the Briefing email show up in Outlook?
        answer: |
          The Briefing email is not a standard email. It's system-generated and does not go through the standard email delivery process. Instead, it's inserted directly into your Outlook inbox by Microsoft Viva. Briefing emails can't be managed by email rules or transport rules.

      - question: How often will I receive the email?  
        answer: |
          Once per workday (as set in Outlook) when you have actions needed to prepare for a meeting or in response to an email. The email is not sent when you have no actionable items.

      - question: Can I change the time of day I get the Briefing?
        answer: |
          Yes. See [Settings](be-settings.md) for details.

      - question: If I have no tasks or meetings, will I still receive a Briefing email?  
        answer: |
          No, you will never be sent an empty email with no content.

      - question: How do I update my mailbox language setting?  
        answer: |
          To confirm or change the language setting for your Outlook mailbox, see [Change the time zone and language settings in Outlook.com](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-the-time-zone-and-language-settings-in-outlook-com-8a34d50d-81b4-40c2-b304-b3d043566389).
          
      - question: Can I stop receiving these emails?  
        answer: |
          Yes. To stop receiving these emails, select **Unsubscribe** at the end of the email.
          
      - question: Can my manager, administrator, or anyone else at my organization see what's in my Briefing email?
        answer: |
          No, the Briefing email is private and for you and only you. All information in the Briefing email is from your mailbox and stored in your mailbox. Everything you see in the Briefing email is information you already have access to in your mailbox. The Briefing email just makes it easier to find items that might need attention.

      - question: Why am I getting so many emails from Microsoft and how can I manage them?
