# Recommendations in the Briefing email

>[!Important]
>We've paused sending Briefing emails to make some improvements. You can still access the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md) or [Viva Insights app in Teams](../teams/introduction.md) for key functionality until this service resumes. For more information about this change, refer to [Briefing pause](../reference/briefing-pause.md).

To help you connect with teammates, wrap up the workday, or minimize email disruption, you might notice some recommendations in your daily Briefing email. When a **Recommended for you** card appears in your Briefing email, you can use it to request regular reminders to send praise or start your virtual commute. You can also use **Recommended for you** to enroll in schedule send suggestions.  

You'll need access to Microsoft Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams to use this section of the Briefing email. Refer to [Discover and pin the Viva Insights app](../teams/viva-teams-app-install.md) for details.

## Praise  

Enrolling in praise reminders can help you establish a habit of recognizing others. If you want to get these reminders and you like the time and day that the **Recommended for you** card suggests, select **Set Reminder**. You'll start getting reminders whenever this time and day occurs next.

If you want reminders on another day or at another time, select **Customize settings**. This option takes you to the Viva Insights app, where you can pick when you want your reminder.

Learn more about the praise feature in [Praise in Viva Insights](../teams/praise.md).

## Virtual commute

Virtual commute helps you mindfully disconnect from work and transition to the rest of your day. If you want to get reminders at the end of your day to start a virtual commute, and you like the time and days of the week that the **Recommended for you** card suggests, select **Let's do it**.

If you want to pick a different time, or set different days, instead, select **Edit settings**. This option takes you to the Viva Insights app, where you can pick when you want your reminder.

Learn more about virtual commute in [Virtual commute](../teams/virtual-commute.md).

## Schedule send suggestions

When you opt in to schedule send suggestions, you'll get an unlimited number of inline suggestions for delaying email delivery to your coworkers, which helps minimize disruptions to recipients outside their working hours or when theyâ€™re away from work. If you want to start using the schedule send suggestions feature, select **Try it out** on the **Recommended for you** card.
