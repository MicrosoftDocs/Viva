# Briefing languages

>[!Important]
>We've paused sending Briefing emails to make some improvements. You can still access the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md) or [Viva Insights app in Teams](../teams/introduction.md) for key functionality until this service resumes. For more information about this change, refer to [Briefing pause](../reference/briefing-pause.md).
