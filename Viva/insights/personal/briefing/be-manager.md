# Catch up with your team

>[!Important]
>We've paused sending Briefing emails to make some improvements. You can still access the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../use/add-in.md) or [Viva Insights app in Teams](../teams/viva-teams-app.md) for key functionality until this service resumes. For more information about this change, refer to [Briefing pause](../reference/briefing-pause.md).


People managers often have hectic schedules, and it can be tough to stay in close contact with your team members. The Briefing can help you maintain a strong relationship with your team and stay caught up and respond quickly to important requests from your team.

Only managers who have team members can see this feature. You can add or edit your team members in [Settings](be-settings.md).

As a manager, you'll see one or more of the following based on your calendar and email activity in the **Catch up with your team** section of your Briefing email:

* **You may have outstanding tasks** - Something you promised to get done or that one or more team members asked you to do.
* **Recent items you may have missed** - Important emails and documents from one or more team members that you haven’t read yet.

If you get the [Adaptive email version](be-overview.md#adaptive-or-html-version), you can also do the following:

* If you see items that may be related, you can select **Done** or **Add To Do**.
* To do the task later, select **Later**.
* Or if it's not a task, select the **Delete** (trashcan) icon to remove it from the list.
