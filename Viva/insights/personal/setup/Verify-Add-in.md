# Confirm installation of the Outlook add-in

The Microsoft Viva Insights Outlook add-in is automatically installed for your organization when you purchase one of the plans or add-ins listed in [Plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md). Users will start to see the Viva Insights Outlook add-in in their Outlook application automatically after a license is assigned to them.

You can confirm that the Viva Insights Outlook add-in is installed by looking in the "Services and add-ins" list for your organization in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
