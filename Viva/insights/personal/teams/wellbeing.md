# Wellbeing

The **Wellbeing** tab in Microsoft Viva Insights helps you understand your work habits, manage your time, and promote a healthy balance between life and work. Start booking time to focus, do a guided meditation with Headspace, read up on wellbeing topics, and more. In this article, we'll explain where and how to access these resources.

## About the tab

In the **Wellbeing** tab, you'll find four main sections: **Take action to improve your wellbeing**, **Track your progress**, **Act with intention**, and **Reflect on your emotions**. 

>[!Note]
> If you're a leader or manager, you'll see an additional section at the top of your Wellbeing tab. Make sure to check out the [For leaders and managers](#for-leaders-and-managers) section later in this article.

### Take action to improve your wellbeing

The **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section helps you change habits, schedule your time, and disconnect from work when the day's over. Pick from these wellbeing-oriented actions:

* Start a daily [focus plan](focus-plan.md)
* Make time for messages
* Schedule [virtual commute](virtual-commute.md) reminders
* Schedule emails for later
* Disconnect with [quiet time](quiet-time.md)
* Take a break or two
* Make time for learning
* Make time for lunch

>[!Tip]
>To find all available actions, use the arrows in the top-right of the section.

For example, let's say your weeks are filling up with meetings and you're finding it hard to carve out time to focus. You think that some dedicated [focus time](focus.md) on your calendar might help. To take action for focus, you'd select **Set daily focus plan** on the **Start a daily focus plan** card. Viva Insights would guide you through a quick setup process to find out which times work best, then schedule that time on your calendar each day.

### Track your progress

After you set up an action, Viva Insights tells you how well it's going in **Track your progress**. 

Let's keep with our focus plan example. When you visit **Track your progress** later on, you'd find stats about your focus time over the last couple of months, and you'd also get an overview of how much upcoming focus time you have over the next seven days.

Your progress section might be your reminder to stick with your wellbeing goals. Or, it might be a way to congratulate yourself on putting your wellbeing first!

   Screenshot of the "Track your progress" section of the Wellbeing tab. The subtitle of the section reads, "Check the impact of your actions and achieve your best work." Beneath the subtitle, there are two cards. The first card is labeled, "Focus plan" and contains a tooltip to its right. It contains a text explanation of how many hours of focus time the user has kept in the last two months and how many hours the user has reserved next week. Beneath this text, there's a horizontal list of the days of the week. Monday through Friday contain a blue circle with a white check; Sunday and Saturday contain an empty gray circle. The next card is labeled, "Quiet time" and it contains a textual explanation of how many days the user had uninterrupted quiet time over the last month. Beneath this text, there's a calendar with blue highlights on various days, representing "Quiet time kept." Both cards contain a "Change settings" link in their bottom left corner.

>[!Tip]
>If you need to make changes to your focus plan or another action you've taken, use the **Change settings** link.

### Act with intention

The **Act with intention** section is your home base for wellbeing content. Switch between topics using the **Focus**, **Meditation**, and **Articles** buttons. 

:::image type="content" source="images/wellbeing-act-intention.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Act with intention, Meditation section with four guided meditation videos users can play.":::

Under:

* **Focus**, start a [focus session](focus.md#start-a-focus-session), [book focus time](focus.md#book-single-non-recurring-focus-sessions), and listen to focus music.
* **Meditation**, start [guided meditations from Headspace](headspace.md) or do a breathing exercise.
* **Articles**, access articles about wellbeing from the [Inspiration library](inspiration.md).

### Reflect on your emotions

In Reflect on your emotions, check in with how you're feeling and observe your reflection trends. Learn more about this feature in [Reflect in Viva Insights](reflect.md)

## For leaders and managers

On the **Wellbeing** tab, you'll find key indicators of your organization's capacity for focused work and work-life balance.

Each day, an insight related to one of the following topics appears at the top of your **Wellbeing** tab:

* Uninterrupted focus hours 
* After hours collaboration 
* No meeting day impact
* Daily connected hours 
* Focus time participation 
* Focus time impact 
* No meeting day participation

On the insight card, view the current week's average measure, the difference from the prior period's average, and the measure's 12-week trend. 

:::image type="complex" source="images/wellbeing-org-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an uninterrupted focus hours organization insight at the top of the Wellbeing tab.":::
   Screenshot of the "uninterrupted focus hours" organizational insight on the Wellbeing tab. The title of the page reads, "Uninterrupted focus hours - is there time for individual work?", with an information icon to the right. Below the title is a numerical indicator of "13.0 hours per person last week" with a text denoting an increase by 1.6 hours. To the right of the indicator is a line graph with months on the X axis and hours, increasing in intervals of 10, on the Y axis. Below the indicator and graph, there's a label with the text, "A shared focus plan invites your team to protect time to get work done." Below the text is a "Set up plan" button and "Show details" link. In the top right of the screen, there's a scope selector indicating that data is being shown for the organization.
:::image-end:::

If you want more information about the insight, including a comparison to peer organizations (for eligible users), a breakdown by team, a percentage distribution, and calculation methods, select **Show details** on the insight card.

:::image type="complex" source="images/wellbeing-org-insights-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the insight detail page for Uninterrupted focus hours.":::
    Screenshot of the Details page for the "Uninterrupted focus hours" insight. The page shows a numerical indicator for the organization and another numerical indicator for peer organizations. Descriptors sit beneath the organization and peer indicators and both contain tooltips. Below the descriptions is a line graph with months on the X axis and hours, in increments of two, on the Y axis, along with a color key indicating "Your organization" and "Peer organization." Below the line graph, there's a "Snapshot from last week" donut chart, which shows a percentage of employees who could benefit from more focus time. There's also a "Percentage of your organization" bar chart, with hours of focus time on the X axis and percentage on the Y axis. On the right of the screen is a card titled, "Block time for focus" that allows users to start a shared focus plan. The card contains a "Set up plan" button and "More actions" links. In the top right of the screen, there's a scope selector indicating that data is being shown for the organization.

To help your team improve their wellbeing, Viva Insights shows you a recommended action—for example, starting a shared focus plan. Select the action button, like **Set up plan**, either on the insight card on the **Wellbeing** tab, or from within the insight details page. Viva Insights then takes you through the feature setup process.

You can also access shared actions in your **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section. Start a shared focus plan or a [shared no-meeting day](shared-no-meeting-day.md).
