# Reflect in Viva Insights

To help you become more aware of how you're feeling, use this feature in the Microsoft Viva Insights app. This awareness can benefit both your productivity and your wellbeing. In fact, research has shown even the act of taking a moment to reflect has positive benefits for wellbeing.

How often you reflect is up to you. Once daily might work well for you&mdash;or you might want to reflect more or less more often than that.

>[!Important]
>Performing self-reflection by selecting the available emojis is an entirely private action. No one else can see what you chose.

## Reflect

To use the reflection feature, go to the **Wellbeing** tab and find the  **Reflect on your emotions** section.

   Screenshot of the Wellbeing tab's Reflect on your emotions section. The subtitle reads, "Take a moment to reflect and better understand your emotions." Below the subtitle, there's a card with two sections. The first section reads, "Private to you" and asks, "How are you feeling?" Below the question, there are five emojis ranging from a big smile to a distressed expression. Beneath the emojis, there's a "Set reminder" button. To the right of the emojis is the Reflection history section, which is a line graph. The Y axis contains the emojis from the previous section; the X axis contains dates. The line shows a user's reflection pattern and the data points correspond to dates. The key shows a symbol for "Multiple selection in a day." The last date on the X axis is highlighted. There are two buttons in the upper right-hand corner: "7 days" and "30 days." "7 days" is selected. Next to the buttons, there's a forward and back arrow. A hover action is shown over one of the data points; the tooltip shows two emojis, arranged vertically, and their corresponding times of day.

Then, select the emoji that best represents how you're currently feeling.

The reflection card gives you feedback to acknowledge your choice.

## View your reflection history

To see how your feelings have changed over time, review the **Reflection history** panel to the right of the emoji selection. **Reflection history** shows you a line graph of the emojis you've chosen either over the last week or the last month; use the buttons in the top right corner to change the view. To see what time you reflected on a particular day, hover over the data point for that date.

## Set a reminder to self-reflect

Want to get in the habit of self-reflecting? Use the **Set reminder** button. 

:::image type="content" source="images/wellbeing-reflect-reminder-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the reflection card, showing reflection feedback, with the Set reminder button highlighted.":::

Viva Insights then picks a time for you to reflect. If you want to edit when you get reminders, select **Change settings**.

If you want to change your reminder settings later:

1. Select the ellipses at the top-left of your Viva Insights app, and then select **Settings**.
1. Select **Reflect** from the left-hand side.
1. Set your preferences and **Save changes**.

>[!Note]
>
>* You can schedule reflection reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.
>* The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders. You cannot set different times for different days of the week.
>* The reminder might not arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but most reminders appear within five minutes before their scheduled time. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could appear between 4:55 and 5:00.
>* Scheduled reflection reminders can expire. If you select a reflection reminder for a previous day or time, you will see a message that the reminder has expired.
>* You can reflect at any time on the Home page or the virtual commute page. Reflection that you do on those pages is independent of any reminders that you have set for reflection.
