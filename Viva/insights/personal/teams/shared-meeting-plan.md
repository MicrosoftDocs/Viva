# Shared meeting plan

>[!Note]
> We're in the process of rolling out these changes to customers.

Shared meeting plans in Microsoft Viva Insights help you promote healthy meeting norms with your colleagues. With shared meeting plans, you can automate the following settings to promote research-backed meeting best practices:

* **Meeting duration** – Give people a breather between events by starting meetings a few minutes late or ending them a few minutes early.
* **Teams link** – Include a Microsoft Teams meeting link to all your meetings so people can attend remotely.
* **Feedback** – Find out how your meetings are doing by sending participants meeting effectiveness surveys.

## For plan organizers

As long as you have a premium Viva Insights subscription, you can create and share a meeting plan. You don't have to be a manager. In this section, we talk about how to create and share a plan with people you choose.

### To create and share a meeting plan

To create a shared meeting plan:

1. Go to the **Productivity** tab in the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web.
1. In the **Recommended for you** section, find the **Promote healthy meeting norms** card and select **Get started**.

   Screenshot of the Recommended for you section in the Viva Insights app Productivity tab. Next to the title, there's an information icon. The subtitle reads, "Get insights, actions, and plans to help you and your peers adopt best practices." Beneath the subtitle, there are three sections: one larger section on the left and two smaller sections on the right. One section on the right is titled, "How your meetings succeeded," and the subtitle says, "Your participants appreciate how you end meetings with clear next steps." The second section on the right is titled, "How your meetings can improve," and the subtitle says, "Some of your recent online meetings may not have started on time due to back-to-back meetings." The section on the left is titled, "Promote healthy meeting norms," and the subtitle says, "Share a customized meeting plan to encourage best practices for meetings." The button below, called "Get started," is highlighted.

Learn a bit more about how a shared meeting plan can help. Then select **Get started**.

:::image type="complex" source="images/productivity-smp-setup-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the intro to the Create a meeting plan process.":::
   Screenshot of the intro to the "Create a shared meeting plan" process. The title says, "Create a shared meeting plan for your team," and the subtitle says, "You're leading the way with effective meeting habits for hybrid work. Set up a customized meeting plan to encourage best practices for meetings." There's a "Learn more" link immediately to the right of the subtitle. Beneath the subtitle, there are three options: "Automatically shorten duration for all meetings," with a subtitle of "Give a breather between back-to-back meetings to promote team wellbeing"; "Automatically include a Teams meeting link," with a subtitle of "Promote team inclusion of both in-person and remote attendees"; and "Get feedback from your meeting attendees," with a subtitle of "Understand how effective your meetings are to encourage feedback." There are two buttons in the bottom right of the window: "Cancel" and "Get started."
:::image-end:::

First, you'll set some meeting norms that affect how your meetings appear on calendars and in Teams. Then, you'll invite participants to join your plan.

#### Create meeting norms

* **Automatically shorten the duration of all meetings** – Choose whether you want events to automatically start late or end early, then pick by how many minutes. You'll set a default number of minutes for meetings that are less than one hour and for meetings that are one hour or longer. When you automatically shorten meetings, you promote wellbeing for all participants by allowing breaks between back-to-back events.

* **Automatically include a Microsoft Teams meeting link** – Select whether every meeting invite includes a link for an online meeting in Microsoft Teams. Adding Teams links promotes hybrid meetings by including both remote and in-person attendees.

* **Get feedback from your meeting participants** – Activate meeting effectiveness surveys for plan participants who have a Viva Insights subscription. Meeting effectiveness surveys promote a healthy meeting culture by providing aggregated feedback to meeting organizers on what’s going well with your meetings and what you could improve in the future.

       Screenshot of the first step of the "Create a shared meeting plan" process. The title is, "Customize your meeting norms." Below the title, there are three options, which correspond to the options described in the preceding bulleted list: "Automatically shorten duration for all meetings," "Automatically include a teams link," and "Get feedback on your meetings." Each option has a check box to its left, which are each selected. Each option also has an information icon to its right. Under "Automatically shorten duration for all meetings," there are three dropdown menus. The first shows "End events early." The second, below the first, has a title of "Less than one hour," and the dropdown menu field shows "5 minutes." the third dropdown, also below the first, has a title of "One hour or longer," and shows "10 minutes." There's a "Back" link on the bottom left of the window. On the bottom right of the window, there are two buttons: "Cancel" and "Next."
    :::image-end:::

When you're done setting your meeting norms, select **Next**.

>[!Important]
>You'll be able to make changes to your personal settings after you start your plan. However, if you want to make changes for everyone, you'll need to leave the plan and start a new one.

#### Invite participants

Type in names to the **Recipients** field. When you're done adding recipients, you're ready to send them an invitation to join your plan. Select **Confirm** to send.

If you have one or more people reporting to you, we'll automatically fill in your team members. You can then add or remove people as you need to.

:::image type="complex" source="images/productivity-smp-setup-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows typing to add participants (step 2/2).":::

The window's title is, "Who would you like to invite?" and the subtitle reads, "Invite your team to participate in the plan with you. Start typing a name to invite more people." Beneath the subtitle is a window showing tags for various invited participants, which includes their profile image and name. There's a search function to the right. A dropdown menu shows suggested participants. There's a "Back" link on the bottom left of the window. On the bottom right of the window, there are two buttons: "Cancel" and "Confirm."

After they get your invitation, recipients can accept or decline it.

## For plan recipients

Anyone with access to the Viva Insights app can join and participate in a shared meeting plan. If you don't have a premium Viva Insights subscription, Viva Insights won't display any settings to request meeting feedback. 

### To join a shared meeting plan

If someone invites you to join a shared meeting plan, you'll get an invitation in Teams. If you want to join the plan and like the settings the organizer has configured, select **Join**. If you want to edit settings for your meetings before joining, select **Edit**.

:::image type="complex" source="images/productivity-smp-invite1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that show's a recipient's Teams invitation to join a shared meeting plan.":::

A subtitle reads, "Join Allan Deyoung and their team in adoption healthy meeting norms. This meeting plan helps you automatically follow research backed meeting best practices." Beneath the subtitle is a "Learn more" link. The section below is titled, "Plan details" and includes details about the three selections the organizer made when they set up the plan. The first reads, "Automatically shorten meetings by ending events early by 5 mins for events less than an hour and by 10 mins for events that are one hour or longer." The second reads, "Automatically add a Teams meeting link to all your meetings." The third reads, "Automatically send a survey to your meeting participants to get feedback on your meetings." On the bottom right of the notification window, there are two buttons: "Edit" and "Join."
:::image-end:::


If you're already part of a shared meeting plan, Viva Insights applies the settings from the plan you were just invited to, then summarizes the changes under **Changes to your plan**. If you're OK with these changes and want to continue joining the plan, select **Join**. If you want to make changes before joining, select **Edit**.

## For all plan participants

After you're part of a shared meeting plan, either as an organizer or a participant, you’ll see that reflected on your **Productivity** tab under the **Your shared meeting plan** section. 

### To edit a shared meeting plan

Anyone who's part of a plan can make changes to their personal settings. Select **Edit** on the **Your shared meeting plan** card, which takes you to your **Settings** page.

To change whether you send out feedback surveys about your meetings, toggle the switch under **Get feedback on your meetings**. You won't find this setting if you don't have a premium Viva Insights subscription.

To start or stop automatically shortening meetings, toggle the switch under **Shorten meetings**. If you're turning on the feature, use the dropdown menus to set how early you want to end your meetings or how late you want to start them.

To add or stop adding Teams links to meetings, toggle the switch under **Add Teams meeting**.

It contains a "Shorten meetings" toggle and a set of dropdown menus to set preferences, along with an "Add Teams meeting" toggle. The subtitle for the "Add Teams meeting" toggle says, "Automatically include a Microsoft Teams meeting link to all your meetings to promote inclusion of in-person and remote attendees."
