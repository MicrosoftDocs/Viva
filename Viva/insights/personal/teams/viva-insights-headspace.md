# Mindfulness content from Headspace

>[!NOTE]
>The Headspace experience is available to you if your language in Teams is set to English, French, German, Portuguese, or Spanish.

Viva Insights has introduced a curated set of guided meditations and Focus music from Headspace. Reach these resources on the [Home](viva-insights-home.md) page to help you start your day grounded, relax your mind before a big presentation, find focus before starting an important project, or close out your day with a mindfulness exercise during your [virtual commute](./viva-insights-virtual-commute.md). In just a few minutes a day, meditation and mindfulness with Headspace can help you decrease stress and increase focus.

## Start a guided meditation

Anytime you want, you can start a guided meditation that's been designed for the current time of day:

1. Open the **Home** page of Microsoft Viva Insights.

1. Locate the pinned Viva Insights app on the left navigation pane of Teams.

2. Right-click the Viva Insights icon.

3. Select **Pop out app**.

   This opens a new window in which the Insights app is running.

4. In this second window, select **More mindfulness exercises** and then start a Headspace meditation or Focus music as described in [Start a guided meditation](#start-a-guided-meditation).

5. Optionally, minimize the Insights window that you just opened. You can continue working in Teams in the original Teams window.
