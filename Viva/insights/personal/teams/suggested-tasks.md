# Suggested tasks

In the **Productivity** tab, use the **Suggested tasks** section to stay connected with your collaborators and improve your productivity.

:::image type="content" source="images/productivity-suggested-tasks3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Suggested tasks page." :::

In **Suggested tasks**, you can:

* [Identify and pin important collaborators](#identify-and-pin-important-collaborators).  
* [Stay on top of commitments, requests, and follow-ups](#stay-on-top-of-commitments-requests-and-follow-ups). 
* [Catch up on unread documents shared with you](#catch-up-on-unread-documents-shared-with-you).
* [Get @mentions from pinned important contacts](#get-mentions-from-pinned-important-contacts).
* [RSVP to upcoming meetings](#rsvp-to-upcoming-meetings).
 
## Identify and pin important collaborators  

While you might get insights from various people, some items might deserve more attention than others. For example, an outstanding task suggestion from your manager or a message from a key customer would probably be of higher priority.  

Based on your collaboration patterns, you can pin some of your contacts as important. All insights from pinned important contacts are shown with higher priority at the top of the **Suggested tasks** section.  

To pin a contact, select the **pin** icon on the bottom left below the contact’s name:

To unpin a contact, select the **unpin** icon:

## Stay on top of commitments, requests, and follow-ups

It's easy to lose track of commitments made over email. To help make sure nothing falls through the cracks, this insight reminds you of tasks you've agreed to do, and others have agreed to do for you, over the last 14 days of email communication. You might find reminders for:

* **Commitments**, which are things you promised or committed to do for someone else over email.
* **Requests**, which are things that other people asked you to do over email.
* **Follow-ups**, which are things that you asked for from others over email.

Here's an example of a commitment. After it's complete, you can mark it as **Done**.

This insight is available in the languages listed in [Briefing languages](../briefing/be-languages.md).

## Catch up on unread documents shared with you

Searching for that document you planned to read but just can't find it? With so many documents shared across meetings and emails, it can be difficult to stay caught up on documents shared by your colleagues. With this insight, you'll get recommended shared OneDrive and SharePoint documents you might need to catch up on.

When Viva Insights suggests catching up on an unread document, select **Open** to read it.

## Get mentions from pinned important contacts

@mention is a common way to tag colleagues on important work items. Viva Insights can help you quickly triage recent @mentions from pinned contacts so that you are caught up on important conversations and tasks in Teams. In the following example, select **Go to comment** to open the conversation and follow up.

## RSVP to upcoming meetings 

Letting your colleagues know if you can join their meeting helps them run more effective meetings. When they have meeting attendance information, meeting organizers can better plan and prepare for meetings, and reschedule them if they need to. 

Select the **RSVP** button to **Accept** or **Decline** the meeting invitation. You can also select the meeting name for more information about the event.
