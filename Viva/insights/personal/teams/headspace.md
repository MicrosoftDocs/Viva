# Mindfulness content in Viva Insights

*Applies to: users whose language in Teams is set to English, French, German, Portuguese, or Spanish. Mindfulness content isn't available to users in the GCC-High or DoD Microsoft 365 environments.*

In your Microsoft Viva Insights app, you'll find a curated set of guided meditations and focus music, including content from Headspace. Start your day grounded, relax your mind before a big presentation, find focus before starting an important project, or close out your day with a mindfulness exercise during your virtual commute. In just a few minutes a day, meditation and mindfulness in Viva Insights can help you decrease stress and increase focus. 

## Start a guided meditation

You can start a guided meditation whenever you want. To find and complete a meditation:

1. In the **Wellbeing** tab in your Viva Insights app, go to the **Act with intention** section, and select **Guided meditations**.

1. Start an exercise by selecting its **Play** button.
1. If you want to do another exercise, select **More exercises**. Otherwise, close the window to complete your meditation.

### Run meditations or music in the background 

Let's say you wanted to listen to focus music while you continued using other features in Teams. Here's how you keep using Teams while also using meditation features: 

1. Locate the pinned Viva Insights app on the left navigation pane of Teams.

2. Right-click the Viva Insights icon.

3. Select **Pop out app**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/pop-out-app2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the Viva Insights right-click Pop out app option from the Teams side panel.":::

4. In the resulting second window, select **More mindfulness exercises** and then start a Headspace meditation or Focus music as described in [Start a guided meditation](#start-a-guided-meditation).

5. Optionally, minimize the Insights window that you just opened. You can continue working in Teams in the original Teams window.
