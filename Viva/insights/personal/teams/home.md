# Viva Insights Home

In the Microsoft Viva Insights app, use the **Home** tab to discover key wellbeing, productivity, and teamwork insights and actions. Here, we highlight insights and actions that give you the most value in the flow of work. You'll find these sections on your **Home** tab:

* Recommended for you
* Your progress
* Inspiration library

>[!Note]
>If you're an organizational leader, meaning you're assigned the **Insights Business Leader** role or your admin has enabled manager access for you, you'll also find an **Insights for your organization** section at the top of your **Home** tab. We talk about organization insights later on, in [For managers and leaders](#for-managers-and-leaders).

## Recommended for you

**Recommended for you** curates content from across the Viva Insights app to highlight actions and insights for individuals. From here, you can:

* Send [praise](praise.md) to colleagues.
* Set up a [1:1 plan](1-1-plan.md) with your direct report.
* Promote [healthy meeting norms](shared-meeting-plan.md).
* Schedule a team [no-meeting day](shared-no-meeting-day.md).
* Start a shared focus plan. 
* Schedule [emails for later](../use/schedule-send.md).
* Relax with [quiet time](quiet-time.md).
* Set [virtual commute](virtual-commute.md) reminders.
* Make [time for messages](wellbeing-plans.md).
* [Mediate](headspace.md) or do a breathing exercise.
* [Reflect](reflect.md) on the day.

## Your progress

Use **Your progress** to find out how well your meetings are going, how well you're keeping quiet time work-free, how many hours of focus time you've booked, and more. If you want to change your settings for the cards here, select their **Change settings** link.

The section includes four cards: "Average meeting rating," which includes a star-rating; "Emails scheduled later," which includes a calendar with kept days filled in with blue; "Focus plan," which includes an indicator for each day that focus time is booked for the next week; and "Quiet time," which includes a calendar with kept days filled in with blue. The "Average meeting rating" card has a "See all feedback" button and the other cards each have a "Change settings" link.

## For managers and leaders

*Applies to: people who have a premium Viva Insights license **and** are assigned the **Insights Business Leader** role or have manager access enabled*

Organization insights help you understand how your organizations—the people who report to you directly or indirectly—are succeeding at work. On the **Home** tab, you'll find key indicators of your organization’s wellbeing, productivity, and team culture, along with features and tools to help support your teams. 

Specifically, you'll find an insight related to one of the following topics each day:

* Uninterrupted focus hours
* Manager 1:1 meeting hours
* Meeting hours
* After hours collaboration
* No meeting day impact
* Daily connected hours
* Focus time participation
* Join on time rate
* Focus time impact
* No meeting day participation
* Multitasking hours
* Internal network size

All insight cards show the current week's average measure, and also provide the difference from the prior period. Here's an example:

The insight includes a title, subtitle, numerical indicator, increase/decrease indicator, a line graph, and a recommended action with a button to begin that action, which is to set up a no-meeting day. There's also a "Show details" link and a share icon.
