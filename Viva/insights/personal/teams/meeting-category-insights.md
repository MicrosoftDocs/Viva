# Meeting category insights

*Applies to: users with a Viva Insights subscription. Refer to [Plans and environments](../overview/plans-environments.md) for more information.*

Use **Meeting category insights** in the **Productivity** tab to help understand how you’re allocating time across your Outlook meeting categories.

>[!Note]
>To set up Outlook meeting categories, refer to [Assign a color category to a calendar appointment, meeting, or event (microsoft.com)](https://support.microsoft.com/office/assign-a-color-category-to-a-calendar-appointment-meeting-or-event-750596d9-707d-4412-8c0e-7fdc0fc52527).
  
In this section, you'll find three types of insights, which are based on meetings  you organized, meetings you accepted, and your appointments:

* **Percentage breakdown**: The percentage of total meeting hours you spend in each meeting category.

* **Meeting trends**: How the time you spend in each meeting category has changed.

    :::image type="content" source="images/productivity-mci-meeting-trends.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows meeting trends.":::

* **Meeting details**: All your meetings in a list, which includes the **Meeting name**, **Category**, **Total time** in the meeting or series, the percentage of attendees who've **Accepted**, the people who've been **invited** and actions (**Cancel**, **Decline**, or **View invite**).

You can customize what you see here. If you want to:

* Analyze a specific category, select it from the checklist to the left.

* Pick a specific timeframe, use the dropdown menu in the top-right. You can choose from **Last 3 months**, **Last 4 weeks**, or **Next 4 weeks**.

* Cancel or decline a meeting, select the button to the right of the **Invited** column.

* View a meeting's invite, use the dropdown button on the **Cancel** or **Decline** button.

>[!Important]
>If you haven’t categorized any meetings between the last three months and next four weeks, these insights won’t be available to you. However, you’ll have access to them after you categorize any meeting within this time period, as long as you have a Viva Insights subscription.
>
> When you make updates to your meeting categories in Teams or Outlook, it can take up to a day for those changes to appear in the **Productivity** tab.
