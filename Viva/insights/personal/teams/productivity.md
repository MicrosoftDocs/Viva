## For managers and leaders

On the **Productivity** tab, you'll find key indicators of your organization’s meeting effectiveness, along with features and tools to help support your teams.

Each day, an insight related to one of the following topics appears at the top of your **Productivity** tab:

* Meeting hours
* Join on time rate
* Multitasking hours

>[!Tip]
>To find other insights, use the arrows to the right of the **Your organization/Your company** dropdown.

On the insight cards, view the current week's calculation result and the change over time for your organization or the group of people who report to you directly or indirectly. If you want more information about the insight, including a comparison to peer organizations (for eligible users), a breakdown by team, a percentage distribution, and calculation methods, select **Show details** on the insight card.

Some insight cards also provide recommended actions. For example, to help your team improve their meeting effectiveness, you can choose to set up a no-meeting day. Select the action button, like **Set up plan**, either on the insight card on the **Productivity** tab, or from within the insight details page. Viva Insights then takes you through the feature setup process.
