# Shared no-meeting day plan

*To start a no-meeting day plan, you need to have a Viva Insights premium license. For more information, refer to [Plans and environments](../../Overview/plans-environments.md). A Viva Insights license isn't required to participate in a no-meeting day plan.*

No-meeting days are a shared recurring time that everyone in the plan can use to focus without interruptions. Days without scheduled meetings:

* Reduce meeting fatigue.
* Give your team some time back to concentrate on individual work. 
* Set a norm within your team to say no to meetings on certain days.

When you organize a no-meeting day plan, Viva Insights schedules an all-day, recurring event and invites the participants you choose. In addition to the event, Viva Insights also sends you and plan participants a [reminder](#before-the-no-meeting-day) the day before the no-meeting day, prompting you to cancel or reschedule conflicting events. Learn more about setting up a plan in [For plan organizers](#for-plan-organizers).

When you accept a no-meeting day invitation from a plan organizer, your calendar shows as **Busy** for a whole workday (or another status the organizer sets, like **Out of office**; you can personalize this setting later). You also get a reminder before the no-meeting day to clear your calendar. Learn more about participating in a plan in [For plan invitees](#for-plan-invitees).

## For plan organizers

### To start, edit, or end a plan

#### Start

As long as they have a premium Viva Insights license, anyone on your team—managers and teammates alike—can start a no-meeting day plan and invite others to join it. Plan invitees don’t have to have a premium license.
Starting and inviting others to a plan is quick and easy. Follow these steps to set up a no-meeting day plan for your team:

1. On the **Wellbeing** tab, find the **No-meeting day** card under **Take action to improve your wellbeing**. Select **Set up no-meeting day**.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/wellbeing-nmd-start1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the No-meeting day start card. The Get started button is highlighted.":::

2. When the setup window appears, fill in:
    1. **Recipients**.

    >[!Tip]
    > You can look up users, Teams groups, and distribution lists here.
    > :::image type="content" source="../images/nmd-find-dist-lists.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the No-meeting day setup window's Recipients field, showing the type-to-find capability.":::

    2. **Settings**.
        1. **When** and **Frequency**: Confirm or change when you want to hold your no-meetings day.
        1. **Start date** and **End date**: Pick when you want your plan to start. You don’t have to set the **End date**.
        1. **Status**.
        
            **Status** is how the no-meeting day appears on participants’ Outlook calendars and in Teams. Confirm this status as **Busy**, or change it to another one, like **Out of office**. Plan invitees can set their own statuses if they want.
            >[!Tip]
            >All-day, booked statuses—like **Busy** or **Out of office**—help dissuade meeting organizers from scheduling meetings during a participant’s no-meeting day.
 
    1. **Note (Optional)**.

        If you want to add a message along with your invitation, type one here. Notes aren’t required.
1. When you’re ready to send your invitation and get your plan started, select the **Schedule** button. Plan invitees get a calendar event invitation in their inbox.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/wellbeing-nmd-schedule1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the No-meeting day schedule window. The Schedule button is highlighted.":::

1. The setup window then shows you a confirmation message with details about your plan. If you want more information, expand the gray arrow under **What happens next?**. Otherwise, select **Done**.
 
#### Edit or end 

After you start a no-meeting day plan, a summary card replaces the card you selected to start the plan. To make changes to the plan or to leave it, select **Change settings**.

:::image type="content" source="../images/wellbeing-nmd-confirmation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the No-meeting day summary card. The Edit button is highlighted.":::
 
On the edit window, you can change your plan’s details. If the only change you make is adding new recipients, Viva Insights sends an update to just those people. If you edit other details, like information under **Settings**, all existing and new plan invitees get an update in their inbox. Updates appear as calendar events, like initial invitations do. To save your changes, select **Send update**.

If you want to end your plan, select **End plan**. On the resulting confirmation box, select **Confirm**. The invitation then disappears from all participants’ calendars.

:::image type="content" source="../images/nmd-end-plan.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the End plan confirmation dialog box, which includes a Confirm button.":::

You can start another plan whenever you want.

## For plan invitees

If someone on your team wants to start a recurring no-meeting day, you get a calendar invitation from them. If you want to participate in the plan, accept the invitation. When you accept, you get a [reminder](#before-the-no-meeting-day) the day before the no-meeting day, and your status shows as **Busy** (or whatever status the organizer set it to) for that entire workday. If you want your no-meeting day to show with a different status—**Free**, for example—you can make that change after you accept the invitation. Open the series in Outlook, then change **Show As:** to the status you want.

:::image type="content" source="../images/nmd-calendar-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Show As option in Outlook, with Busy in the text box and the dropdown menu expanded to show all options.":::

If you don’t want to participate in the plan, decline the invitation. You don't receive a reminder before the no-meeting day, and your calendar doesn't adopt the event or show the status that the organizer set.

## Before the no-meeting day

When you’re enrolled in a no-meeting day plan—either as an organizer or invitee—Viva Insights sends you a notification the day before a scheduled no-meeting day. This notification prompts you to prepare for the no-meeting day by rescheduling or canceling any conflicting meetings.

To review conflicting events, select **Review schedule** within the notification. Then, use the dropdown arrows to RSVP to these events. You’ll start your no-meeting day with a clean slate, ready to dedicate your focus to individual, sustained work.

If you’d rather not get this notification, change your settings in the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web:

1. Select the ellipses (**…**) at top-right, then select **Settings**. 
2. Select **Protect time** from the left pane.
3. Under **No-meeting day plan settings > Send reminders to clear conflicts on no-meeting days?**, select **No**.
