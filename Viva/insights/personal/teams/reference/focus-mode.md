# Focus mode

If you selected the option to be reminded to begin focus mode, you will be prompted by Viva Insights in Teams to start focus mode. When you select the **Ready to focus** prompt, it'll open a **Focus mode** page.

You can also start focus mode through **Home** > **Launch focus mode**. Or if you leave focus mode, you always restart it through **Home** > **Return to focus mode**.

* If Headspace for Viva Insights is enabled by your organization, you'll see options to play music and a **Focus timer** that tracks your time within the **Focus mode** page.

* If Headspace is disabled, you'll be prompted to play a short one-minute **Deep breathing** exercise within the **Focus mode** page. You'll also see a **Focus timer** that tracks your time.

### Pop out Focus mode

You can open **Focus mode** in a separate pop-out window in Teams, which allows you to play focus music while using Teams for other work.

1. In the left navigation in Teams, right-click **Viva Insights**.
2. Select **Pop out app**.
