# Mindfulness content from Headspace

>[!NOTE]
>The Headspace experience is available to you if your language in Teams is set to English, French, German, Portuguese, or Spanish.

Viva Insights has introduced a curated set of guided meditations and Focus music from Headspace. Reach these resources on the [Home](viva-insights-home.md) page to help you start your day grounded, relax your mind before a big presentation, find focus before starting an important project, or close out your day with a mindfulness exercise during your [virtual commute](./viva-insights-virtual-commute.md). In just a few minutes a day, meditation and mindfulness with Headspace can help you decrease stress and increase focus.

## Start a guided meditation

Anytime you want, you can start a guided meditation that's been designed for the current time of day:

1. Open the **Home** page of Microsoft Viva Insights.

## Run Headspace in the background

In Teams, you can open and run Viva Insights in a new window. This lets you play Headspace meditations and Focus music while continuing your collaboration in Teams.

1. Locate the pinned Viva Insights app on the left navigation pane of Teams.

2. Right-click the Viva Insights icon.

3. Select **Pop out app**.

   This opens a new window in which the Insights app is running.

4. In this second window, select **More mindfulness exercises** and then start a Headspace meditation or Focus music as described in [Start a guided meditation](#start-a-guided-meditation).

5. Optionally, minimize the Insights window that you just opened. You can continue working in Teams in the original Teams window.
