# Configure the app

Use the **Settings** page to configure the features for the Microsoft Viva Insights app. For example, you can turn reminders on or off, change the day and hour settings for features like [Praise](viva-insights-reflect.md) and [Reflection](viva-insights-reflect.md), and set your lunch hours.

To reach the **Settings** page, select the **ellipsis** (...) in the upper-right corner of any page, and then select **Settings**.

You can configure settings for the following features:

| Feature | Settings |  
|---|---|
| Workweek |  Edit the days of the week that you work, your start time, end time, and your time zone. These settings are kept synchronized with the same settings in [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/options/calendar/view/appearance). That is, if you change them in one place, they'll be updated everywhere that they appear. 
| Briefing |  *We've paused sending Briefing emails to make some improvements. Users can still access the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../../use/add-in.md) or [Viva Insights app in Teams](viva-teams-app.md) for key functionality until this service resumes. For more information about this change, refer to [Briefing pause](../../reference/briefing-pause.md).* 
| Virtual commute | Choose whether you want a reminder to wrap up your day and when you want to see that reminder. 
| Protect time | Use the **Protect time** section to update: <ul> <li>**Quiet time**. Mute mobile notifications after certain hours and all day on the days you pick. </li><li>**Schedule send suggestions**. Choose whether you want a notification in Outlook to send emails that align with recipients' working hours. For more information about schedule send suggestions and in-line suggestions, refer to [Schedule send suggestions](../../use/schedule-send.md). </li><li>**Productivity inline suggestions**. Turn on this feature to see suggestions when you're composing emails or meeting invites in Outlook. These suggestions help book focus time, manage tasks, and more. Read more about inline suggestions, refer to [Schedule send suggestions](../../use/schedule-send.md).</li><li>**Lunch hours**. Set your lunch hours and choose whether you want a recurring calendar event to protect that time. Viva Insights uses this setting to improve recommendations for booking focus time and meetings.</li><li>**No-meeting day plan settings**. To clear conflicts before a planned no-meeting day, Viva Insights sends you a reminder. Select **No** if you'd rather not get this reminder.</li><li>**Focus plan**. Set your Focus plan preferences, like how much time you want to spend focusing, when you prefer to focus, and more. For more information about using this setting and about focus plans, refer to [Protect time with Viva Insights](viva-insights-protect-time.md#book-focus-time-or-a-plan).</li><li>**Breaks, learning, and message catch-up plans**. Configure settings for other protect-time plans. For more information about updating these plans, refer to [Protect time with Viva Insights](viva-insights-protect-time.md#create-other-plans).
| Reflection| To get in the habit of regular check-ins, you can set up a reminder to reflect. Learn more about the **Reflect** feature in [Reflect in Viva Insights](viva-insights-reflect.md).
| Praise | Like **Reflection**, you can set up regular reminders to send praise to your colleagues. Learn more about the **Praise** feature in [Praise in Viva Insights](viva-insights-praise.md).
| Effective meetings| Use these settings to have Viva Insights automatically add a Teams link to your meeting invite or shorten your meeting durations. You can also turn on and off meeting effectiveness survey requests. For more information about meeting effectiveness, refer to [Effective-meetings in Viva Insights](effective-meetings.md).
| Privacy| Use this section to opt in or out of the following features: <ul><li>**Viva Insights**. If you want Viva Insights to stop using your collaboration data to display personal insights, toggle the switch from **On** to **Off**. If you opt out, you'll lose access to a number of features. For information about opting out of Viva Insights, refer to [Opt out of Viva Insights](../../use/opt-out-of-mya.md).</li><li>**Insights Outlook add-in**. If you don't want to see insights in Outlook, toggle this switch from **On** to **Off**. Learn more about the Outlook add-in here: [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../../use/add-in.md).</li><li>**Viva Digest email**. If you want to stop getting the twice-monthly Digest email, toggle this switch from **On** to **Off**. Learn more about the Digest email here: [Viva digest emails](../../use/email-digests-3.md).

## About reminders

As described above, you can set reminders for several features in the Viva Insights app. You can schedule these reminders for any day of the week, including days not configured as workdays in your Outlook settings.

When you set reminders:

* The time you select will apply to every day on which you'll see reminders; you can’t set different times for different days of the week.  
* They won’t arrive at exactly the scheduled time, but within 15 minutes on either side of the scheduled time. For example, if your reminder is scheduled for 5:00, the reminder could show up anytime between 4:45 and 5:15.
* Each reminder shows up in your Teams activity feed. When you see it, you can select it there and it'll open the feature (reflection, praise, virtual commute, or no-meeting day) directly in the Viva Insights app.
