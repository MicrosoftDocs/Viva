# Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web

>[!Note]
>The Viva Insights app is being redesigned over the coming weeks. Here's an overview of what's changing: [Viva Insights app redesign](../reference/viva-insights-app-redesign.md). 
>
>If you don't yet see the new app experience, find previous documentation at this link: [Viva Insights Home](./reference/viva-insights-home.md).

The Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams and on the web shows you personalized recommendations that help you do your best work. Get insights for building better work habits, like following through on commitments made to collaborators and protecting focus time in the day for uninterrupted, individual work.

Viva Insights derives these insights by summarizing your Microsoft 365 data&mdash;data that you already have access to&mdash;about emails, meetings, calls, and chats.

By using the Viva Insights app, you can increase your:

* [Wellbeing](wellbeing.md) &ndash; Block out time to focus, catch up on messages, learn, and take breaks; mindfully close out your workday; silence messages and emails during your off-hours; do a guided meditation; reflect on how you're feeling; and more.
* [Productivity](productivity.md) &ndash; Make your meetings more effective and keep up on your tasks.
* [Teamwork](teamwork.md) &ndash; Connect with your network; evaluate your communication habits; and praise colleagues.

## To find the app

### On Teams

To find and pin the app in Teams, refer to Discover and pin the Viva Insights app.

### On the web

To access Viva Insights on the web, go to https://insights.viva.office.com or use the Microsoft 365 app launcher at https://office.com. 


If your organization is in the Government Community Cloud (GCC)-High Microsoft 365 environment, go to https://insights.viva.office365.us. If your organization is in the Department of Defense (DoD) Microsoft 365 environment, go to https://dod.insights.viva.office365.us. 

## How it works

The personal insights and actions in the Viva Insights app are based on your Exchange Online mailbox, like email and calendar data. The insights are derived from data that's already available to you in your Exchange Online mailbox. For example, if you want to determine what commitments you made to others, you could manually review each email in your mailbox. The Insights app just saves you from this tedious process.

## Privacy

The insights for individuals that this app presents are completely personal and private. Personal insights in the app are for your eyes only; neither your manager nor the system administration can see your insights. For more information, see the [Privacy guide](privacy.md).


>[!Note]
>To access the Viva Insights app, you need to have an Exchange Online license and access to Teams. To access certain features, you'll need a premium Viva Insights subscription.
