# Personal insights app FAQ

The following are the most frequently asked questions about personal insights within the Microsoft Viva Insights app in Microsoft Teams.

##### Q1. Does the Microsoft Viva Insights app comply with GDPR? 

**A1.** Yes. The Viva Insights app complies with GDPR requirements. (See [GDPR compliance](privacy.md#gdpr-compliance).)

##### Q2. Can users see information about other users in the Viva Insights app?

**A2.** The personal insights in the Insights app include only existing information that’s already available in the user’s mailbox. The insights surface content from documents, emails, and meetings to make it easier for the user to find what’s most important for their day ahead. Users cannot see any new information about other users that wasn’t already available in their mailboxes.

##### Q3. Can my manager, administrator, or anyone else at my organization see what’s in my Viva Insights app?

**A3.** No. Personal insights are private and visible to you. Personal information in the Insights app is from your mailbox and stored in your mailbox. Insights just make it easier to find items that might need attention. However, if you give another person, such as an administrative assistant [read and manage mailbox permission](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/give-mailbox-permissions-to-another-user#read-email-in-another-users-mailbox), then that person can also see your personal insights within your mailbox.

##### Q4. How can I send feedback to Microsoft about the Viva Insights app?

**A4.** In the bottom-right corner of each page, the Insights app asks, "Is this helpful?". Select **Yes** or **No** to provide feedback.

After you select **Yes** or **No**, a dialog box shows up. Use this share more feedback. If you want to allow Microsoft to follow up with you about your feedback, select the **You can contact me about this feedback** box. Then, select the **Submit** button.

##### Q5. What data does the Viva Insights app use?

**A5.** Viva Insights uses:

* Information from email items:
  * Metadata, including the email's timestamp, names of sender and recipients, and "read" status.
  * Task statements. Statements that people have made in the body text of the email. Viva Insights uses these statements to create task cards for your use only.

* Information from calendar items:
  * Type (meeting or appointment)
  * Status (busy, free, out-of-office, tentative)
  * Category
  * Subject
  * Duration
  * Attendees
* OneDrive SharePoint data: Viva Insights shows a count of OneDrive and SharePoint documents that you have worked on.

   Insights does not use:  

   Email and calendar data from people outside your organization, with the following exception: Insights uses data that is present in your own Office 365 mailbox. For example, if you conduct a meeting with a person outside your organization, the start and end times of that meeting are in your mailbox and are visible to you. This data, therefore, can be used in computations about your collaboration history.

##### Q6. Why don't I see the insights and suggestions I've read about in documentation?

**A6.** To have access to the Viva Insights app, you'll need an Exchange Online license.

##### Q7. How can I stay updated with the latest Viva Insights features and learn from peers who are using the tool for their organizational needs?

**A7.** We encourage all Viva Insights users to visit and register on the [Viva Insights community](https://community.vivainsights.microsoft.com/t5/Viva-Insights-blogs/bg-p/viva-insights-blog). The community has:

* Forums to connect with peers and discuss shared experiences.
