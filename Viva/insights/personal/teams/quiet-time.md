# Quiet time

Research shows that long hours and the pressure to always be available can lead to employee burnout. The amount of time you spend collaborating outside of business hours can be an indicator for your risk of burnout, even as you and your team embrace flexibility.

To protect your non-working hours, and to help you disconnect and recharge from work, use quiet time in Microsoft Viva Insights. When you set up quiet time, we'll silence mobile notifications from Outlook and Teams, depending on the preferences you set.

## Set up quiet time

Here's how you get your quiet time set up:

1. Go to the **Wellbeing** tab in your Viva Insights app.
1. In the **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section, find the **Disconnect with quiet time** card, then select **Set quiet time**.

3. On the resulting page, select when you want Viva Insights to start and stop silencing Outlook and Teams notifications. In **Mute mobile notifications all day**, pick days you want Viva Insights to mute notifications for a full 24 hours.

The subtitle says, "Mobile notifications for Outlook email and teams are muted during quiet time." There are two subsections below. The first sub-section reads, "Mute mobile notifications for certain hours," with a tooltip to its right. Below the header is a "Start time" label with a dropdown menu, which contains "6:00 PM." To the right of the "Start time" label is an "End time" label with a dropdown menu, which contains "7:30 AM." Beneath the dropdown labels, there's a checklist of all seven days of the week arranged horizontally; every day has a check except Saturday. To the right of the section is a toggle turned on. The second sub-section reads, "Mute mobile notifications all day" with a tooltip to its right. Beneath the title is another horizontal checklist of days of the week. Sunday and Saturday have checks. To the right of the section is a toggle turned on. At the bottom of the section, there's a "Save changes" button.

## Track your progress

Curious about how your quiet time is going? The **Track your progress** section on the **Wellbeing** tab reports how many days you've kept quiet time in the last month.

Beneath the subtitle, there are two cards. The first card reads, "Focus plan" and contains a tooltip to its right. It contains a text explanation of how many hours of focus time the user has kept in the last two months and how many hours the user has reserved next week. Beneath this text, there's a horizontal list of the days of the week. Monday through Friday contain a blue circle with a white check; Sunday and Saturday contain an empty gray circle. The next card reads, "Quiet time" and it contains a textual explanation of how many days the user had uninterrupted quiet time over the last month. Beneath this text, there's a calendar with blue highlights on various days, representing "Quiet time kept." Both cards contain a "Change settings" link in their bottom left corner.
