# Time management features in Viva Insights

*Applies to: users with a Viva Insights subscription*

Like with focus, Microsoft Viva Insights can help you protect time on your calendar to:

* Take scheduled breaks.
* Learn.
* Catch up on messages.
* Take a regular lunch.

## To start using time management features

To start using time management features through the Viva Insights app:

1. Go to the **Take action to improve your wellbeing** section of your **Wellbeing** tab. 
1. Pick a topic that suits your goals, and then select the action button at the bottom of the card. For example, if you want to reserve some time each day to learn a new skill, you'd select the **Set aside time** button on the **Make time for learning** plan card.
    >[!Tip]
    > To find all your options, use the arrows above the rightmost card.

## About automatic booking

When you start using a time management feature in Viva Insights, we automatically find time on your calendar and book time for the feature you picked--for example, catching up on messages. We book time on your calendar in the same way we do for focus plans. To learn more about automatic booking, refer to our [focus plan documentation](focus-plan.md#concepts).
