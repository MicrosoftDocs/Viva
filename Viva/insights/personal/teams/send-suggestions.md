# Schedule send suggestions in Teams chat

*Applies to: users with a Viva Insights subscription*

To help you communicate with coworkers during their working hours, Viva Insights suggests times to send chats that might otherwise arrive after hours.

Maybe you’re working a different schedule than your colleagues, or maybe you're in a different time zone. Whenever and wherever you are, these suggestions help build healthy collaboration habits and minimize work-related notifications during personal time.

## About schedule send suggestions

### Who can use suggestions

If you meet the following criteria, you'll get an unlimited number of schedule send suggestions in chat: 

* You have a Viva Insights subscription.
* You're using the Teams app on Windows, Mac, or the web.

### When you'll get suggestions

If you're messaging someone in a one-on-one chat, and they're outside their working hours, you might get a suggestion to send the message later.

You won't get suggestions in the following scenarios:

* When you're sending a message to yourself
* When you’re sending a message marked as important or urgent
* When you’re composing a message during the 30 minutes before the recipients’ or your working hours

1. You'll get a confirmation about when Viva Insights will send your chat, which you can select to make changes. To update when the message sends, use the dropdown menus on the confirmation to select a new day or time. If you're not ready to send your message or need to make some edits, select **Close**. If you don't want to schedule sending the message after all, select **Cancel scheduled time**.

There's a window above the text-input box. In the top section of the window, there are two dropdown menus: one has "Thursday, October 13" filled in; the other has "8:00 AM" filled in. Both have arrows users can select to set a new value. Beneath these dropdown menus, there are three buttons: "Send at scheduled time," "Cancel scheduled time," and "Close." The send icon has a small clock icon within it.
