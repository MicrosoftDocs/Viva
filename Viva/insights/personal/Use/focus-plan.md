# Focus plan

Meetings, emails, and chats are necessary to get work done, but they often leave us with little time during the workday for uninterrupted individual work. Some people report spending over 80% of their day collaborating with coworkers, and research has shown that it can take over 20 minutes to refocus after checking just one email.

The focus plan in Microsoft Viva Insights helps you block regular time for your top-priority work by scheduling up to four hours every day to focus. The plan also lets you configure your focus-plan settings to match your needs:

* You can silence or allow chats in Teams.
* You can mute or unmute team notifications.

You can create, configure, or end your focus plan at will. For more information, see [To create your focus plan](#to-create-your-focus-plan) and [To change or leave your focus plan](#to-change-or-leave-your-focus-plan). 

## To create your focus plan

You can create your focus plan in three places:

* [Viva Insights app](#in-the-app)
* [Dashboard](#in-the-dashboard)
* [Insights Outlook add-in](#in-the-insights-outlook-add-in)

### In the app

From the Viva Insights app Home page:

1. Locate the **Focus time** card beneath **Improve work life balance**.
1. Select **Get started**.

 ![Screenshot that shows the Focus time card and Get started button.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-plan-enroll.png)

3. If this is:

    * Your first time using a focus plan, you'll be prompted to confirm settings in **Focus plan preferences** after you select **Get started**. These settings are described further in the next section.
    * *Not* your first time using a focus plan, Viva Insights automatically starts booking focus time for you. You can change your settings later in **Focus plan preferences**.

#### By using Protect time

Alternately, you can set up your focus plan through **Protect time**. To get there, either directly select the **Protect time** tab, or select **More options** on the **Protect time** card on the Home page.
    ![Screenshot that shows the Protect time card and More options link.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-time-more-options1.png)

In the **Protect time** tab:

1.	Locate the **Focus plan** card.
1. Select **Get started**.
   
    ![Screenshot that shows the Focus plan card and the Get started button.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-plan-get-started.png)

2.	If this is:
    * Your first time using a focus plan, you'll be prompted to confirm settings in **Focus plan preferences** after you select **Get started**. These settings are described further in the next section.
    * *Not* your first time using a focus plan, Viva Insights automatically starts booking focus time for you. You can change your settings later in **Focus plan preferences** or by selecting **View settings** on the card.
   
        ![Screenshot that shows the Focus plan card and the View settings link.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-plan-view-settings.png)

### In the dashboard

1. In the header of the **Focus** page of your personal dashboard, select **Get started**. 

   ![Focus plan - Get started.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-dashboard-get-started.png)
<!--waiting on new screenshots-->
2. Select the number of hours of focus time you would like Viva Insights to book for you every day, and then select **Next**.

   ![Focus plan - Choose hours.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-plan-choose-hours-83.png)

3. Select the time of day for your focus time, and then select **Next**.

   ![Focus plan - Choose AM or PM.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-plan-choose-am-pm-101.png)

4. Select whether to have Teams chat notifications muted during focus time, and select **Looks good**.

     ![Focus plan - Choose to mute chat notifications.](../../Images/mya/use/focus-plan-choose-mute-105.png)

     Viva Insights now looks for time in your Outlook calendar to set aside for focusing, based on your preferences. The amount and placement of focus time depends on the time your calendar has open.

     See [Automatic booking of focus time](#automatic-booking-of-focus-time) for details.

### In the Insights Outlook add-in

1. Select the **Want focus time every day?** insight.

   ![Screenshot that shows Want focus time every day? insight](../../Images/mya/use/outlook-focus-plan-start.png)

2. Select **Book time now**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Create your focus plan window with Book time now option.](../../Images/mya/use/book-time-now.png)

   The Insights pane now notifies you that your focus plan has begun, and your calendar now contains focus-time blocks:

   ![Screenshot that shows the Outlook add-in's focus plan confirmation window.](../../Images/mya/use/outlook-focus-plan-confirmation.png)

Now that your focus plan is underway, you can do the following: 

* [Check the progress of your focus plan](#to-check-the-progress-of-your-focus-plan).
* [Change or leave your focus plan](#to-change-or-leave-your-focus-plan).


## To check the progress of your focus plan

After your plan has started, you can check your progress and make sure that you have focus time booked every day over the upcoming two weeks. If the plan has run for at least few days, it will have numbers to report.

In the dashboard, select **Focus** on the left pane to see statistics about your focus time:

   ![Dashboard report.](../../Images/mya/use/track-progress.png)
  
An important metric shows under **Last week** about how many days last week that you had time to focus.

The **Plan ahead** area helps you plan focus time for the upcoming days with the following sections.

### Focus time booked

For the current week and the following week, this area shows how many days and which days have had focus time booked. In the preceding example screenshot, the three days with focus time booked are shown in green.

### Needs focus time

This section shows upcoming days that have no focus time booked but still have open time available. Select **Book now** to have Viva Insights select and book this time.

### Needs review

During the number of days shown (in the screenshot, three days) Viva Insights has either found no time to book or it has found booked focus time that has a meeting conflict. Select **Review** to open your calendar in Outlook on the web to resolve the issue.

>[!Note]
>If you make changes to your Outlook calendar, they will be reflected on your dashboard within five minutes.

## Concepts

The following sections provide information that can help you as you create or monitor focus plans.  

### Automatic booking of focus time

After you set automatic booking as your preference, Viva Insights starts looking for time on your Outlook calendar to set aside as focus time. The scheduled focus time shows in your calendar as a different color and is labeled "Focus time."

Focus time never creates a calendar conflict; that is, focus time will not be booked over any existing calendar event, such as all-day meetings, booked personal time, or appointments.

Although two hours is the maximum length of a focus-time block that can be scheduled automatically, you can extend your focus time, by hand, in your Outlook calendar.

#### Booking schedule

Viva Insights books focus time two weeks in advance. For example: when you open your calendar on a Monday, you should see focus time booked every day of the current week and all the way through the Friday of the following week. Each weekend it looks for time blocks in the next week out and books time accordingly.

#### How time slots are selected

The time it reserves for you depends on the time you have open during the day. Viva Insights starts its search at the beginning of your workday, as it is defined in your Outlook settings. 

Viva Insights also respects the **Do not schedule focus time earlier than** setting in the **Plan configuration** dialog box. For example, if you set this to 9:00 AM, Viva Insights will select no focus-time slots that begin earlier than 9:00 AM.  

Viva Insights also prioritizes your preferences for length of focus time slots and part of day (morning or afternoon). For example, if you choose four hours of focus time and choose afternoon, Viva Insights first scans your calendar to find four-hour open slots in the afternoon. If it finds no four-hour open slots in the afternoon, it continues to scan your calendar to find four-hour open slots in the morning. If only smaller amounts of time are available, it can book focus blocks as short as 30 minutes. 

After it books a block on one day, it then moves on to the next day to find the next suitable block, based on your preferences. (In most cases, it creates only one block of focus time per day.) 

#### Lunchtime

Viva Insights considers the time from noon to 1:00 PM as time for the midday meal. If you have automatic booking turned on, Viva Insights tries to book any other time of day first. If it finds no other blocks of time available, it will then book focus time during the lunchtime period.

### Chats are muted during focus time  

During focus time, your status in Teams and Skype for Business will automatically change to "Focusing" to silence chat notifications and help you stay focused. When the focus time appointment ends, your status will automatically revert back to the status you were previously in. Note that you can set priority contacts in Teams to ensure you don’t miss important messages during focus time.

For more information, see [Manage notifications in Teams](https://support.office.com/article/manage-notifications-in-teams-1cc31834-5fe5-412b-8edb-43fecc78413d).

### Digest emails and Viva Insights Outlook add-in

#### Focus plan digest

After you enroll in a focus plan, the content in your digest email will be tailored based on your participation in the plan. It might, for example, remind you to schedule focus time for days on which none is set aside.

#### Viva Insights add-in

You can open the Outlook add-in to check whether any upcoming days are missing focus time. To do so, use this card:

![Add-in feed card.](../../Images/mya/use/add-in-feed-card.png)

Selecting this card shows the following options, with which you can book focus time on individual days or for several days at once:  

![Book focus time inline.](../../Images/mya/use/book-focus-time-nudge.png)
