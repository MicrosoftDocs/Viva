Viva Insights provides personalized recommendations to help you do your best work. Get insights to build better work habits, such as following through on commitments made to collaborators and protecting focus time in the day for uninterrupted, individual work.

It derives these insights by summarizing your Microsoft 365 data, which you already have access to, such as emails, meetings, calls, and chats.

With Viva Insights, you can:

* **Plan focus time** - Review and plan this week's focus time or enroll in a structured focus plan.
* **Manage your network** - Shows all the internal and external people you have recently collaborated with through meetings, emails, chats, or calls.
* **Personal insights** - Shows you productivity and wellbeing tips and ideas, which come from different resources, such as academic and industry research. This section refreshes periodically to reflect your most recent work patterns.
* **Set your working hours** - The app uses the **Work week** settings in **Settings** to derive your personalized insights.
* **Enable Delay Delivery** - When **Delay Delivery Enabled** is set **On** in **Settings**, the app uses it to schedule email delivery at a time that aligns with the recipients' working hours.  

## Privacy

Only you can see your data. The same privacy protections used for your personal insights in Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams apply to this Home page. See [Privacy guide](/insights/viva-teams-app-privacy) for details.

## Config Settings

Your personalized insights are based on the working days, working hours, and time zone that you set in **Config Settings**. Changes to these settings are reflected in next week's data.

You can also select to automatically book focus time or only get reminders to schedule focus time for the next two weeks. For more details, see [Focus plan](../use/focus-plan.md).
