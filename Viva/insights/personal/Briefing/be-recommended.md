# Recommendations in the Briefing email

To help you connect with teammates, wrap up the workday, or minimize email disruption, you might notice some recommendations in your daily Briefing email. When a **Recommended for you** card appears in your Briefing email, you can use it to request regular reminders to send praise or start your virtual commute. You can also use **Recommended for you** to enroll in a Delay delivery plan.  

You'll need access to Microsoft Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams to use this section of the Briefing email. Refer to [Discover and pin the Viva Insights app](../teams/viva-teams-app-install.md) for details.

## Praise  

Enrolling in praise reminders can help you establish a habit of recognizing others. If you want to get these reminders and you like the time and day that the **Recommended for you** card suggests, select **Set Reminder**. You'll start getting reminders whenever this time and day occurs next. <!--verify there's no latency period.-->

If you want reminders on another day or at another time, select **Customize settings**. This option takes you to the Viva Insights app, where you can pick when you want your reminder.

Learn more about the praise feature in [Praise in Viva Insights](../teams/viva-insights-praise.md).

## Virtual commute

Virtual commute helps you mindfully disconnect from work and transition to the rest of your day. If you want to get reminders at the end of your day to start a virtual commute, and you like the time and days of the week that the **Recommended for you** card suggests, select **Let's do it**.

If you want to pick a different time, or set different days, instead, select **Edit settings**. This option takes you to the Viva Insights app, where you can pick when you want your reminder.

## Delay delivery plan

When you opt in to a Delay delivery plan, you'll get an unlimited number of inline suggestions for delaying email delivery to your coworkers, which helps minimize disruptions to recipients outside their working hours or when they’re away from work. If you want to start using the delay delivery feature as part of the Delay delivery plan, select **Try it out** on the **Recommended for you** card.
