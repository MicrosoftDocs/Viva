**To check your Outlook settings**

You can update your settings in Outlook to change what time is counted as after-hours work:

1. In Outlook, select the **File** tab and select **Options**.
2. In the Outlook Options dialog box, select **Calendar**.
3. In the Work time area, adjust the settings for Start time and End time and your selections for days of the Work week.
