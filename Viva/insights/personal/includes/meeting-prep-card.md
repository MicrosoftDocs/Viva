## Meeting preparation

Meetings are vital for healthy collaboration. Better meeting practices can improve productivity, information sharing, innovation, decision making, and team connectedness.<!-- Read more about best practices for running effective meetings in this playbook.-->

The meeting preparation card shows you a list of upcoming meetings that you have organized, and it helps you evaluate whether each meeting is ready to go.

#### To view and use the meeting preparation card

1. On the **Home** ribbon of Outlook, select the **Insights** icon. If the **Insights** panel isn’t already open, it opens now.
2. On the **Insights** panel, locate the **Prepare for your meetings** card: 

    ![Meeting preparation card.](../../Images/mya/use/meeting-prep-card.png)

    This card provides information about meetings that you have organized for this week and next week (up to 10 business days in the future) and it helps you evaluate the state of those meetings. 

3. Select the **Prepare for your meetings** card. This opens a panel that displays insights cards for each of your upcoming meetings:

These insights cards inform you of the following:

| Card section | Notes | Recommendations |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------- |
| (Card title) | Meeting title and time of occurrence |
| Attendees    | The percentage of invitees who have accepted, and the number of invitees. Click **See details** for more information. | **Ensure that you have a quorum** before the meeting. Consider sending a reminder to attendees if you haven’t heard from them. |
| Agenda       | **Yes** or **No** indicates whether the meeting invitation includes an agenda. | **Agendas** often make a meeting run smoother. If your meeting requires an agenda, select **Agenda** in the card. This opens the meeting invitation, where you can add an agenda. |
| Attachments  | This section shows how many attachments the invitation has, it displays their titles and their storage location (online or locally), and it lets you click to see more details. It also provides a link that you can select to open the attachment, if the attachment is stored online. |  
| Online meeting link | **Yes** or **No** indicates whether the meeting invitation includes a link for joining the meeting online. | **Be an inclusive meeting organizer**. If you have attendees who are working remotely, consider adding an online link to your meeting. To do this, select **Online meeting link** to add one.  |
| Preparation time | This section provides options to book either 15 minutes or 30 minutes of preparation time right before the meeting. This option only appears if there is an available slot. Booked time appears on your calendar and references the meeting, as “Preparation time for [meeting title].” You can also cancel the meeting-preparation time or delete it directly from your calendar. | **Be prepared**. If you need travel time or have other tasks that need to be done immediately before the meeting to prepare for it, consider booking preparation time.  |

_This card shows the **Attachments** section in its expanded state, which lets you see more details about the attachments:_
