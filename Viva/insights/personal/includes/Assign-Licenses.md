>[!Note]
>Assigning licenses with a Viva Insights service plan turns it on for those participants. Before you do this, you might notify them in email that Viva Insights will be available soon. They'll automatically receive a [Welcome email](..\Use\MyA-Welcome-email.md) from Viva Insights also.

### Personal insights elements

After you assign a user license with the Viva Insights service plan, the new participant will gain access to the following personal insights elements.  

* **Viva Insights welcome email**
  
  * Existing users of Microsoft 365 will receive the welcome email a few days (up to four weeks) after their license is granted.
  * New users will receive the welcome email approximately four weeks after their license is granted.

<!-- Note> Users will not receive the welcome email outside of their work week. If a user's set work week is Monday to Friday, and the person's welcome email would otherwise arrive on a weekend, its arrival time is delayed to the following Monday. For more details, see [Viva Insights welcome email](../Use/MyA-Welcome-email.md).-->
* **Personal insights dashboard** - Users can visit their [Dashboard](../Use/dashboard-2.md) a few days after their license with the service plan is granted.

    >[!Important]
    > The dashboard will be retired soon, but users can still access personal insights content through their Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web. [Read more about this change](../reference/mya-retirement.md).

* **Insights Outlook add-in** - Users can see the [Insights Outlook add-in](../Use/add-in.md) in a day or so after their license with the Viva Insights service plan is granted.
* **Digest emails** - Users will begin to receive the [Microsoft Viva digest](../Use/email-digests-3.md) within two to three weeks after they receive the welcome email.
* **Inline suggestions** - Users can see the [inline suggestions](../use/mya-notifications.md) in a day or so after their license with the Viva Insights service plan is granted.
