**To change your weekly goals**

1. For the category (such as Email hours or Focus hours), select **Edit goal**.
2. In the dialog box that appears, type a number for your new goal, and select **Save**. Your new goal is displayed in the overview. When you change a goal, the goals for previous weeks are also changed.
