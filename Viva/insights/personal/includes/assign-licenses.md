>Assigning licenses with a Viva Insights service plan turns it on for those participants. Before you do this, you might notify them in email that Viva Insights will be available soon. They'll automatically receive a [Welcome email](..\Use\MyA-Welcome-email.md) from Viva Insights also.

  * Existing users of Microsoft 365 will receive the welcome email a few days (up to four weeks) after their license is granted.
  * New users will receive the welcome email approximately four weeks after their license is granted.

* **Personal insights content in Teams and on the web** - Users can visit their [app in Teams and on the web](../teams/introduction.md) a few days after their license with the service plan is granted.
* **Insights Outlook add-in** - Users can see the [Insights Outlook add-in](../Use/add-in.md) in a day or so after their license with the Viva Insights service plan is granted.
* **Digest emails** - Users will begin to receive the [Microsoft Viva digest](../Use/email-digests-3.md) within two to three weeks after they receive the welcome email.
