# Productivity insights in Outlook

_Powered by Microsoft Viva Insights_

Did you ever miss an important email or forget a commitment you made to your co-workers? Do meetings and emails tend to take over your calendar?  Would you like to be notified if an upcoming meeting doesn't have a quorum?  

If your answer to any of these questions is _yes_, the Outlook add-in provides actionable insights to help you stay on top of your tasks and get more done.  

## Insights that you might see

Open the Viva Insights Outlook add-in by selecting the **Viva Insights** icon on the Outlook **Home** ribbon. If you are using  Outlook on the web, open an email message, select the **ellipsis** (**...**) in the top-right corner of your email message, and then select **Viva Insights**.

## Privacy by design

This Outlook add-in preserves all the data-subject rights afforded by GDPR. The insights you see in the add-in are only available to you. No admin or manager can see these insights. They are computed as needed, from your email and meeting information, and are never stored outside your mailbox.

Additionally, the add-in begins processing data for insights only after the first time you open it. [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/CloudServices/office365/default.aspx) about how Microsoft protects your privacy.
