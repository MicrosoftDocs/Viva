# Viva Insights app redesign

To make it easier to navigate and find new features in the Viva Insights app, we're making a few changes this March. After these changes roll out, you'll continue to access Microsoft Viva Insights in your Teams app and on the web at https://insights.viva.office.com/ (https://gcc.insights.viva.office.com/ for Government Community Cloud customers). However, things will look a bit different when you get there.


## What's changing?

### Tabs and navigation

*Applies to: all Viva Insights users*

After we roll out these changes, you'll notice four main tabs arranged vertically on the left side of the screen: **Home**, **Wellbeing**, **Productivity**, and **Teamwork**. You'll also notice that previous tabs, like **Protect time** and **Stay connected**, aren't available.

Even though we're changing our tab organization, the content should feel familiar. We’re bringing over content from **Stay connected**, **Effective meetings**, **Inspiration library**, **Protect time**, **Organization trends**, and **Teamwork habits**. You'll even notice some new features, and find them easier to get to and use.

We give a quick tour of our new tabs [below](#what-will-the-new-app-look-like).

### Consolidated content from MyAnalytics

*Applies to: all Viva Insights users*

We’re including key insights from the [retired MyAnalytics dashboard](mya-retirement.md), like network and collaboration habits, in the redesigned Viva Insights app. While we're discontinuing some MyAnalytics insights (for example, charts that show weekly time available to focus versus time spent collaborating), you'll now find all your personal insights in one place, right in your Viva Insights app.

### Team creation

*Applies to: all Viva Insights users*

Because Viva Insights will only rely on official organizational data to create teams, you'll no longer be able to create a team or modify team members. If you don’t manage direct reports, you won’t be able to access manager insights within your digest email, or access manager 1:1-related content.

### Distributed team insights

*Applies to: managers with fewer than three reporting layers*

The **Teamwork habits** tab, which provides a consolidated view of team insights and capabilities, will no longer be available. Instead, you'll find insights about your team distributed across all four new tabs. We talk more about these insights in [Content for leaders](#content-for-leaders).

### Distributed leader insights

*Applies to: managers with nine or more reports and fewer than three reporting layers*

The **Organization trends** tab, which provides a consolidated view of leader insights, will no longer be available. Instead, you'll find insights about your organization distributed across all four new tabs. We talk more about these insights in [Content for leaders](#content-for-leaders)

New leader insights with associated actions

You'll notice a few new aggregated insights for leaders, including uninterrupted focus hours, daily active hours, focus time adoption, focus time impact, and join on time rate. These new insights include:

* Recommended actions, like setting up a no-meeting day or shared focus plan.
* Insight trends over time.
* Insights contextualized from peer organizations and broken down by organization within your company.

### What will the new app look like?

#### Home

We built the **Home** tab as your jumping-off point to explore and use Viva Insights features, and also to summarize important benchmarks.

:::image-end:::

From **Home**, you'll be able to:

* Send praise to colleagues.
* Set up a shared meeting or focus plan.
* Start a no-meeting day with your team.
* Access Headspace meditations and reflect about the day.
* Set up schedule send suggestions for emails.
* Check in on your focus plan and quiet time progress.
* Read **Inspiration library** articles.

#### Wellbeing

We designed the **Wellbeing** to help you understand your work habits, act with intention, and achieve a sustainable work-life balance. Features you used to find on the **Protect time** tab—focus time and focus plan, virtual commute, and quiet time progress—will appear in **Wellbeing**. Looking for the reflect or Headspace meditation features? Those will be here too, along with wellbeing-related articles from Harvard Business Review, Thrive, and Microsoft WorkLab.

#### Productivity

Effective meetings and clear tasks are key to increasing productivity. 

That's why we built the **Productivity** tab—to help you identify ways to identify and decrease non-productive meeting time, and also stay on top of your work with suggested tasks. Content you used to find in **Effective meetings** (meeting surveys, meeting categories insights, shared meeting plans, and meeting habits) and **Stay connected** (suggested tasks) will soon live in **Productivity**.

#### Teamwork

With its insights on network and collaboration, **Teamwork** will become your hub for building and strengthening connections with your team. We're moving some familiar content from your MyAnalytics dashboard here—like network and collaboration habits—so you can get a quantitative picture of who you collaborate with and how.

### Content for leaders

Like in the current design, the redesigned Viva Insights app will still contain insights for leaders to help you drive productivity, promote work-life balance, and strengthen connections with your team.

Every day, you'll find a different featured insight on each tab. Each tab (except **Home**) contains insights related to different key indicators for your group:

* **Wellbeing** – Focused work and work-life balance

    :::image type="content" source="../../Images/MyA/reference/redesign-wellbeing-org-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows org trends on the Wellbeing tab." lightbox="../../Images/MyA/reference/redesign-wellbeing-org-insights.png":::

* **Teamwork** – Manager coaching and networks

    :::image type="content" source="../teams/images/teamwork-org-insights2-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Teamwork insights for your organization section on the Teamwork tab."lightbox="../teams/images/teamwork-org-insights2.png":::

* **Productivity** – Meeting effectiveness

    :::image type="content" source="../../Images/MyA/reference/redesign-productivity-org-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows org trends on the Productivity tab." lightbox="../../Images/MyA/reference/redesign-productivity-org-insights.png":::

**Home** works a little differently. Insights on the **Home** tab draw from insights on the **Productivity**, **Wellbeing**, and **Teamwork** tabs. Each insight shows the current week's average measure, along with the difference from the last week. 

:::image type="content" source="../teams/images/home-org2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows org insights on the Home tab." lightbox="../teams/images/home-org2.png":::

You'll notice several new insights throughout each tab, including **Meeting hours**, **No-meeting day impact**, **Join on time rate**, and **Focus time impact**. You can share insights with others through a Teams chat or direct link. Additionally, you can view insight trend lines, peer comparisons, comparisons across groups within your organization, and distributions. 

## When will these changes happen?

We’ll begin a targeted release for these changes in early March 2023 and complete our worldwide rollout by early April 2023.

## What should I do to prepare?

Review and assess the impact on your organization. Consider updating your documentation as appropriate to reflect the above changes.
