# MyAnalytics dashboard retirement, redirects, and Viva Insights unified settings

As Viva Insights in Teams and on the web is becoming the central place for personal insights, we’re retiring the MyAnalytics dashboard. As a part of this retirement, we’re doing two things:

1. Redirecting users from Digest email and MyAnalytics dashboard to Viva Insights web app 
1. Offering unified settings in the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web for worldwide and Government Community Cloud (GCC) users

## What's changing? 

The MyAnalytics dashboard, in its current form, won’t be accessible after mid-December 2022. Instead, you’ll be redirected to the Viva Insights web app to discover key work-pattern insights. We’re streamlining your experience between the dashboard and the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web. Here’s how: 

### Redirection

Right now, you access the MyAnalytics web dashboard through https://myanalytics.microsoft.com/, https://myanalytics-gcc.microsoft.com/, or through links in the Viva Digest email (like if you wanted to dive deeper into your work pattern insights) and Outlook add-in. After this change, we’ll automatically redirect you to https://insights.viva.office.com/ or https://gcc.insights.viva.office.com/. You’ll also be able to find the Viva Insights web app in the Microsoft 365 app launcher on office.com.

### Feature availability

The following select MyAnalytics functionality will continue to be available as a part of the Viva Insights apps in Teams and web. In the future, additional work-pattern insights from MyAnalytics will be highlighted alongside productivity and wellbeing experiences in the Viva Insights apps in Teams and web to support building better work habits.

#### Focus time booking and insights

[Focus time booking](../teams/viva-insights-protect-time.md#schedule-focus-time) helps you block regular time by scheduling up to four hours every day to focus. You can access the focus time configuration settings by selecting the ellipses (**…**) at the top right of the Viva Insights app, selecting **Settings**, then selecting **Protect time** from the left pane. You can also access these settings by selecting **View focus plan preferences** on the **Focus time insights** card.

Focus time Insights are available on the **Protect Time** page on Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web. These insights show the amount of focus time kept in the current month and the amount of focus time booked for the following week.

#### Quiet time insights 

[Quiet time insights](../teams/viva-insights-protect-time.md#configure-quiet-time) are available in the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web, on the **Protect time** page. These insights show the number of days when quiet time was kept without quiet time interruptions in addition to displaying a calendar view of quiet time days in a four-week duration. 

This feature also lets you configure your quiet time settings to match your needs during the initial setup or after setup.

#### Meeting habits

Meeting habits highlight your meeting habits or practices. You can switch between the **Habits** view and the **Meetings** view on the **Effective meetings** page of Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web.  The **Habits** view shows data about your meeting habits based on the meetings on your calendar over the past four weeks. The **Meetings** view shows details about all the meetings on your calendar over the past four weeks.

### Settings

A unified settings experience will be available in the Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web. These unified settings will let you modify Digest email settings, Briefing email settings, some MyAnalytics settings, and Viva Insights Outlook add-in settings. Here are a few more details about these settings:

#### Digest and Briefing emails 

When you select the settings modification link within the semi-monthly Digest emails or the daily Briefing email, you’ll be redirected to the relevant email setting on Viva Insights web app. Currently, you’re directed to the email settings on the MyAnalytics web dashboard. 

You can also access these settings through the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web by going to the Settings page.

##### Digest

On the **Setting** page’s **Privacy** tab, you can opt out of the Digest email by switching the **Viva Digest Email** toggle off. To opt back in, switch the toggle on.

##### Briefing

Select the **Setting** page’s **Briefing** tab to find your Briefing email settings. At the top of the page, toggle the switch off to opt out of the Briefing email. You can opt in again later by toggling the switch on.

You’ll also be able to use a new Briefing email setting to personalize your favorite and snooze preferences. Selecting **Favorite** allows you to prioritize a particular card in your future Briefing emails; selecting **Snooze** allows you to de-prioritize a particular card in your future Briefing emails.

##### Outlook add-in

These Viva Insights Outlook add-in settings that currently only exist in the add-in experience will now also be available on the **Settings** page on Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web:

* On the **Privacy** tab:

    * **Insights Outlook Add-in** toggle: Use this toggle to opt in and out of the Outlook add-in experience.

* On the **Protect time** tab:
    * **Lunch hours**: Set up a recurring calendar event for your lunch time. Viva Insights uses this setting to improve recommendations for booking focus time and meetings. 

    * **Schedule send suggestions**: Viva Insights offers these suggestions to help users schedule email delivery at a time that aligns with working hours. 

    * **Productivity inline suggestions**: Viva Insights displays Productivity inline suggestions on emails and meetings in Outlook to help book focus time, manage tasks, and more.

### Opt-out

Right now, the ability to opt out of the Digest email and Outlook add-in exists in MyAnalytics web dashboard. After this change, as described earlier, these two settings will be available on Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web.

## When will these changes happen?

The above changes will roll out between 11/21/2022 and 12/12/2022 (worldwide and GCC). You can continue to access Personal insights documentation at [Personal insights introduction](../introduction.md).

## What do I need to do to prepare?

Review and assess the impact on your organization. Consider updating your documentation as appropriate to reflect the above changes.
