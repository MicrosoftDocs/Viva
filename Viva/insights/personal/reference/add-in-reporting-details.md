# Reporting details in the Viva Insights Outlook add-in


Viva Insights does not display read information about every email that you send, such as in the following circumstances.

## Qualifying messages requirement

Read statistics are shown only for _qualifying messages_. A qualifying message is an email message that is sent to five or more qualifying recipients. A qualifying recipient is a person who is in the same company as the sender and has a cloud mailbox. Distribution lists are expanded before counting qualifying recipients.

## Exceptions to qualifying messages

Viva Insights does not report about email messages in the following categories:

* Email that was sent from a shared mailbox
* Email that was sent more than 14 days ago.
* Email in which the total number of recipients (the sum of all of the recipients in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields) is less than five.
* Email sent to modern groups. (If users are following the modern group, they are included in the count.)

## Open rate

Viva Insights respects user privacy. For this reason, the Viva Insights add-in does not show information about individual recipients, and when necessary to protect privacy, it reports approximated values only.

Within 30 minutes of when you sent qualifying email, the Viva Insights add-in  reports the actual or an approximated open rate, as described here:

* **Below minimum.** For open rates lower than the minimum threshold, the threshold value is reported. For example, when 20% of 10 email recipients open the email, Viva Insights displays the open rate as "_&lt; 25%_."
* **Between thresholds.** If the actual open rate falls between the "Minimum" and "Maximum" values shown in the table, then the actual open rate is reported.
* **Above maximum.** For open rates higher than the maximum threshold, the threshold value is reported. For example, when 96% of the 25 email recipients open the email, Viva Insights displays the open rate as "_&gt; 95%_."

   | Number of recipients | Open rate reported |
   | ------- | ------ |
   | 5 - 10  | Minimum: 25% <br>Maximum: 75% |
   | 11 - 20 | Minimum: 10% <br>Maximum: 90% |
   | &gt; 21 | Minimum: 5%  <br>Maximum: 95% |
