# Introducing Microsoft Viva Insights

[Microsoft Viva Insights](https://insights.office.com/VivaInsights/) is part of [Microsoft Viva](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva). Microsoft Viva brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights into an employee experience that integrates seamlessly into the apps you use every day, such as Microsoft Teams.

Viva Insights includes a Microsoft Teams and web app, along with web features and tools, that help people and businesses thrive with data-driven, privacy-protected insights and recommendations to improve productivity and wellbeing.

* [**Personal insights**](./personal/teams/introduction.md) - Get personal insights that only you can see. Insights, like those in the [Viva Insights app](./personal/teams/home.md) and in a [Briefing email in Outlook](./personal/briefing/be-overview.md), help you learn about how you work and what you might change to do your best work. Get useful recommendations, such as protecting time in the day for regular breaks, focused work, and learning that help improve wellbeing and boost productivity.
    >[!Important]
    >We're pausing sending Briefing emails starting January 15th, 2023, to make some improvements. You can still access the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](personal/use/add-in.md) or [Viva Insights app in Teams](personal/teams/home.md) for key functionality until this service resumes.
* [**Team insights**](./org-team-insights/team-insights.md) - Team insights give much-needed visibility into work habits that might lead to burnout and stress. These habits include regular after-hours work, meeting overload, or too little focus time. Team members can use these insights to help their teams strike a balance between productivity and wellbeing. They can also learn how their habits impact their team while getting suggestions on how to foster team culture.
* [**Organization insights**](./org-team-insights/org-insights.md) - Organization insights help qualifying managers and business leaders see how their work culture is affecting aspects of employee wellbeing and productivity. They can use the recommendations on the Outcomes page to see opportunities where a change could improve their business outcomes.
* [**Advanced insights**](./advanced/introduction-to-advanced-insights.md) - Similar to organization insights, **Advanced insights** can also help business leaders address critical questions about organizational resiliency and work culture with insight into how work impacts their people and their business. Leaders can see opportunities where a change in process could improve business outcomes and take steps to protect employee wellbeing.
* [**Data privacy**](./advanced/privacy/privacy.md) - Learn how Viva Insights complies with applicable laws and regulations and how to protect and keep personal data private.
