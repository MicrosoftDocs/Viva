## What does Viva Insights include?
Viva Insights includes insights for your employees, managers, and leaders:
- **[Personal insights](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/personal-insights-in-viva-insights-1d501790-479b-44f4-9876-97538869fc73)** supply private, personalized feedback for individual employees. These insights help people learn about their work patterns, how to improve their wellbeing, and boost productivity. Example recommendations are protecting time in the day for regular breaks and scheduling time for focused work and learning.
- **[Team insights](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/team-insights)** for managers give much-needed visibility into work habits that might lead to burnout and stress. These habits include regular after-hours work, meeting overload, or too little focus time. Team members can use these insights to help their teams strike a balance between productivity and wellbeing. They can also learn how their habits impact their team while getting suggestions on how to foster team culture.
- **[Organization insights](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/org-insights)** help managers and business leaders see how their work culture is affecting aspects of employee wellbeing and productivity. They can use the recommendations on insights and report pages to see opportunities where a change could improve their business outcomes.
- **[Advanced insights](/viva/insights/advanced/introduction-to-advanced-insights)**  help business leaders address critical questions about organizational resiliency and work culture, with insight into how work impacts their people and their business. Leaders can see opportunities where a change in process could improve business outcomes and take steps to protect employee wellbeing.
- **[Copilot dashboard](/viva/insights/org-team-insights/copilot-dashboard)** helps organizations maximize the value of Microsoft 365 Copilot. It provides actionable insights to help your organization get ready to deploy AI, drive adoption based on how AI is transforming workplace behavior, and measure the impact of Copilot.
