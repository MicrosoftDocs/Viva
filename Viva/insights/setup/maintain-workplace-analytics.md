# Maintenance tasks

After you have installed and set up Microsoft Viva Insights, it will require maintenance by an admin. Some maintenance tasks are infrequently required, while others must be done regularly.  

## Update system defaults

* **Task** - Set the default time zone and the default settings for working days and hours.  
* **Frequency** - As needed to update settings.

## Update privacy settings

* **Task** - Configure the following privacy settings:

  * Set the minimum-group size for data shown in analysis.
  * Show or hide subject lines from analysis.
  * Update settings to exclude emails or meetings for specific email addresses, from specific domains, or key terms in subject lines for emails or meetings.

* **Frequency** - As needed to keep the settings up-to-date.

## Update organizational data

* **Task** - Prepare a .csv file that contains organizational data and upload it to the advanced insights app.
* **Frequency** - Update organizational data as frequently as you like; however, it will be refreshed upon the latest Microsoft 365 collaboration data. Because email, calendar, and Microsoft Teams data is updated weekly, it makes sense to update this data on a similar cadence in Viva Insights.

## Assign licenses

## Set up meeting exclusions

* **Task** - Create custom meeting exclusion rules to remove meetings from analysis.  
* **Frequency** - As needed, create these rules to exclude meetings that might skew your data.
