The following describes who does what to assign admins roles for Microsoft Viva Insights:

* **Owner** - The [Microsoft 365 global admin](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) assigns Viva Insights roles and the Azure Active Directory [Application Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator) assigns roles for the advanced insights app
* **Task** - Assign admins for Viva Insights
* **Outcome** - Admins must set up Viva Insights for their organization. After data is provisioned, admins can then assign roles to other people in their organization to use Viva Insights.

You must assign admins of the Viva Insights service the role of **Insights Administrator**. Admins are required to set the system defaults, privacy settings, upload and verify organizational data, and assign other people roles for using Viva Insights.
