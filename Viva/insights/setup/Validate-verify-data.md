# Validate and verify data

The following describes who does what to validate and verify data to upload in Microsoft Viva Insights:

* **Owner** - Viva Insights admin and data analysts with full access
* **Task** - Ensure that Microsoft 365 data is available and ready for analysis, ensure the correct organizational data has been uploaded and is ready for analysis.
* **Outcome** - Viva Insights admins are comfortable that data has been provisioned successfully, and data analysts are comfortable with the data and ready to use Viva Insights for their analysis.
