## Use of data other than English

If and when you are able to use the advanced insights app with _data_ that is in other languages, do the following as a guideline:

* Column headers for the organizational data when you [prepare the organizational data](../admin/prepare-org-data.md) must be in English.
* When an analyst selects metrics while building a [query](../analyst/person-query-overview.md), the metric names they choose can be in the language of their choice.
* For content within organizational data, you can use languages other than English.
* .csv files generated by Viva Insights are UTF-8 encoded. Excel doesnâ€™t automatically use UTF-8 when opening .csv files, which may cause garbled characters. Refer to [Access query results and modify existing queries](../analyst/query-results.md) to learn how to import a .csv file in Excel..
