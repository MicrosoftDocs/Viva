> [!NOTE]
> In Microsoft Teams, teamwork and communication happen in channels. Viva Insights includes several metrics which measure aspects of team communication over channels in Teams. When these metrics first become available in the Advanced insights app, they will reflect a baseline of only 14 days of historical data; this historical data will increase as time progresses. This differs from other metrics, which usually have 13 months of historical baseline data.

>[!Note]
>The Copilot active days metrics may capture Copilot actions that are not yet captured in Viva Insights metrics. For example, "Copilot actions taken in Teams" might return a figure that's larger than the sum of the metrics representing the actions employees can take with Copilot in Teams, such as "Summarize meeting actions taken using Copilot in Teams." This data gap will be closed over time.

## Exported metrics

These metrics aren't selectable within the **Metrics** pane when you build queries, but they're included in query output.

Applies to|Name| Description|
|---|-------|------------|
|Person queries |IsActive | Boolean value of "true" or "false" for each employee. Active employees send at least one email or Teams chat during the unit of time—day, week, or month<sup>1</sup>—defined by the query’s **Group by** setting. 

<sup>1. You might notice differences when comparing metrics summarized by day with metrics summarized by week; a person can be active in a week, but not necessarily active seven days of the week.</sup>
