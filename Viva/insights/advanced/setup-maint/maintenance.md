# Maintenance tasks

After you've installed and set up Microsoft Viva Insights, it requires maintenance by an admin. Some maintenance tasks don't need to be done regularly, while others do.

## Update privacy settings

* Task – Configure privacy settings: set the minimum-group size for data shown in analysis.
* Frequency – As needed to keep the settings up to date.

## Update organizational data (optional)

* Task – Prepare a .csv file that contains organizational data and upload it to the advanced insights app.
* Frequency – Update organizational data as frequently as you like; however, it will be refreshed upon the latest Microsoft 365 collaboration data. Because email, calendar, and Microsoft Teams data are updated weekly, it makes sense to update this data on a similar cadence in Viva Insights.

[Upload organizational data (subsequent uploads)](../admin/upload-org-data-subsequent.md)

## Assign licenses

* Task – Assign licenses to individuals.
* Frequency – As needed, such as to add a new employee.

[Assign licenses](./assign-licenses.md)

## Assign roles

* Task – Assign roles to individuals or groups.
* Frequency – As needed, such as to assign a new employee a role, or when an existing employee changes roles.

## Validate and verify data

* Task – Use the **Data quality** tab to verify that the organizational data is loaded and ready for use.
* Frequency – As needed, particularly after uploading organizational data.
