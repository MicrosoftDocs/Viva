# Environment requirements for Viva Insights

Environment requirements vary depending on the type of insights you view in Microsoft Viva Insights. The types of insights are: personal insights, manager insights or leader insights in Microsoft Teams, and advanced insights in the web-based service.

## Personal insights

Microsoft Viva Insights provides personal insights in the [Viva Insights app in Teams and on the web](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/viva-insights-app-in-teams-and-on-the-web-f07f80a1-177d-4541-9185-31493b74fc0f), [Briefing emails](../../personal/Briefing/be-overview.md), [Viva digest emails](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/digest-email-0e8b9a77-d1ce-4139-82bc-e91a3cb909c3), [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/about-the-viva-insights-outlook-add-in-48b73ccf-4086-4f13-9f62-dcee91a9df6d), and [inline suggestions](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/inline-suggestions-in-outlook-064a323e-6dc7-40e9-ab1b-199de8d39db5).

The table above isn't a complete list of Viva Insights features. Other cards might appear depending on your type of plan.

### Browser support

You can use the following web browsers to view all web-based personal insights features.

* Microsoft Edge or Edge Chromium (coming soon)
* Microsoft Internet Explorer version 10 or 11
* Google Chrome (latest version)
* Apple Safari (latest version)
* Mozilla Firefox (latest version)

As an Outlook add-in, the Insights Outlook add-in requires a browser compatible with your system's platform and operating system. For details, see [Browsers used by Microsoft 365 add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins).

### Language support

Personal insights in Viva Insights are available in most of the same languages as Microsoft 365. See [What languages is Office available in](https://support.office.com/article/what-languages-is-office-available-in-26d30382-9fba-45dd-bf55-02ab03e2a7ec).

See [Briefing languages](../../personal/briefing/be-languages.md) to see what's supported for Briefing emails and [Advanced insights language support](../../overview/supported-languages.md) for what's supported for advanced insights.

### Prerequisite and exclusion

* **Prerequisite**: [Microsoft Exchange Online](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description) is required. 

  > [!Note]
  > Also refer to **Prerequisites to access the Viva Insights Outlook add in** in [About the Viva Insights Outlook add-in](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/about-the-viva-insights-outlook-add-in-48b73ccf-4086-4f13-9f62-dcee91a9df6d).

* **Licensing exclusion**: Shared mailboxes aren't supported.

## Manager, leader, and advanced insights

With the applicable [Viva Insights licensing](#viva-insights-licenses), your company can get manager and leader insights in Teams, and advanced insights features as an add-on to the licensing agreement.

Microsoft Exchange Online provides much of the collaboration data that Viva Insights uses. For this reason, we recommend you have a Microsoft 365 or an Office 365 product that contains Exchange Online Plan 1 and Plan 2.

## Channel support

Other channels such as Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) don't support the addition of Viva Insights at this time. Also, note the following circumstances for various types of customers:

|  Type  | Notes |  
|---- | ---- |
|Education | Supported only for the analysis of faculty at this time, not for students. |
|Commercial | You can add Viva Insights with commercial enrollments. |
|Non-profit | Viva Insights can be used by nonprofits but non-profit pricing isn't available. |

## Tenant environments

Viva Insights requires the applicable [Viva Insights licensing](#viva-insights-licenses) and a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 tenant with Exchange Online Plan 1 or Plan 2.

## Viva Insights licenses

[Assign licenses](assign-licenses.md) to the users whose mailboxes you want to analyze. They include all the employees in your organization or a specific subset. To ensure statistical significance and meaningful comparative analysis, companies get the most benefit when they deploy Viva Insights to the entire company or to a large group of employees.

## Pricing

Contact your Microsoft account team for pricing. If you have questions about licensing, have your admin reach out to your Microsoft account team, or use [this form](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/buy-insights) to inquire about Viva Insights.

## Supported browsers

For the best experience, use Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox are not preferred browsers for the advanced insights app available with Viva Insights. Internet Explorer is no longer a supported browser.

## Service availability during an outage

Microsoft provides oversight, framework, and tooling to ensure that products like Viva Insights can maintain functionality and recover from a service outage. All Microsoft 365 applications are required to have a Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) plan. 

If there’s an outage, Viva Insights will use a failover process to switch to a backup location. This ensures customers will continue to have access to existing reports, and all organization insights features (Manager/Leader and Analyst/Advanced Insights experience) will still be available. Users, however, won't be able to create new queries and reports until the primary region is back up and running.

Service availability is consistent across environments where Viva Insights plans are generally available. For details, see [Microsoft Viva Service Descriptions](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-viva-service-description).
