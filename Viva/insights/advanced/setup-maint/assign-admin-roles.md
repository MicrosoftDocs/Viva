# Assign admin roles

Admins for Microsoft Viva Insights set privacy settings, upload and verify organizational data, and assign other people roles for using Viva Insights.

Before they can set up the app and start in on those tasks, however, they'll need to have the **Insights Administrator** role assigned by the following people:

* [Microsoft 365 global admin](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles): assigns Viva Insights roles *or* 
* Azure Active Directory: [Application Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) assigns roles for the advanced insights app 

## Roles and access levels

See [User roles](user-roles.md) for detailed role descriptions and access levels.

## Assign user or group roles

See [Assign user or group roles](assign-user-roles.md) for details.
