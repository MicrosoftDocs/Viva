# Viva Insights setup overview

Depending on the insights you want to see and which features they need, the setup process for Microsoft Viva Insights varies. This article gives a quick overview of the different types of insights available in Viva Insights and what you need to do to get things up and running.

## Personal insights

Your admin needs to set up Viva Insights for personal insights before you can start using the different personal insights apps that are available. For details, refer to the [Admin guide for personal insights](/viva/insights/personal/overview/mya-for-admins).

## Team insights

Team insights are available to people with a premium Viva Insights subscription and one or more people directly reporting to them.

You can access team insights throughout the Viva Insights app on the web or in Teams. To access through Teams, you'll need to set up the Viva Insights app in Teams. For details about setting up the app, refer to  [Install, pin, and configure the app](../../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md). For more information about team insights, refer to [Team insights](../../org-team-insights/team-insights.md).

## Organization insights

Organization insights throughout the Viva Insights app in Teams and web offer more features to people who've been enabled as managers. Before you can start using organization insights, your admin needs to:

* Enable you as a manager, which they can do through the **advanced insights app > [Manager settings](./manager-settings.md)**.

* Get the Viva Insights app set up in Teams so you can view insights there. For details, refer to  [Install, pin, and configure the app](../../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-install.md). In addition to in Teams, you can also see the Viva Insights app on the web. For more information about organization insights, refer to [Organization insights](../../org-team-insights/org-insights.md).

## Advanced insights

Before you can use Viva Insights' advanced analysis tools, your admin needs to complete the required steps in [Set up advanced insights](./setup.md). These steps include assigning licenses.
