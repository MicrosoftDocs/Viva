# Export Viva Insights data using MGDC

>[!Note]
>This feature is for public preview customers. Features in preview might not be complete and could undergo changes before becoming available in the broader release.


If you want to use and analyze Viva Insights data outside of the Viva Insights app, you can use Microsoft Graph Data Connect (MGDC) to transfer the backend data to Azure. This process allows users to export whatever subset of metrics they want from Viva Insights, which can include both system metrics and customized metrics.

### Prerequisite steps

1. Provide the Tenant ID to the Viva Insights team. The Tenant ID can be found in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Under **Azure services**, select **Microsoft Entra ID**, then find the **Tenant ID** on the **Overview** page.
1. The [Global Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator) will need to assign the relevant roles for the steps below, if they are not already assigned.

### Process overview

| Task | Role | Resources required |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Create Azure Active Directory Application  |  Application Administrator or Application Developer   |  |
| 2. Provision Storage Account  |  Application Administrator or Application Developer   |  |
| 3. Provision Key Vault and store client secret  |  Application Administrator or Application Developer   | App secret |
| 4. Enable MGDC for tenant  |  Global Administrator   |  |
| 5. Mark a Viva Insights query for export  |  Insights Analyst   |  |
| 6. Register MGDC application  |  Azure AD Application Owner, with Insights Analyst role   | Storage account, Azure AD Application  |
| 7. Consent to application/dataset  |  Global Administrator   |  |
| 8. Deploy ARM template  |  Application Administrator or Application Developer, with Insights Analyst role  | MGDC app, App secret, Container |
| 9. Execute pipeline  |  Application Administrator or Application Developer   | Data factory |
| 10. Find the output of your extraction |  Application Administrator or Application Developer   | Container name  |


>[!Note]
>When you export Viva Insights data using MGDC, you won’t incur any additional fees unless you exceed the monthly egress data limit. Each month, you can export data for an analyzed population of up to 20 times your Viva Insights license count. For each license, you can include an employee in up to 20 queries. For example, in a tenant with 100 licenses: <br><br /> • You can export 20 queries, each with data from 100 unique employees. <br><br /> • Or, you can export 40 queries, each with data from 50 unique employees. <br> <br /> • Or, you can export 10 queries with data from 150 unique employees each and five queries with 100 unique employees each. <br><br /> If your tenant exceeds the monthly limit, Microsoft may contact you to review your current needs. These specific limits described are subject to change.

## Steps

<a name='1-create-azure-active-directory-application'></a>

### 1. Create Microsoft Entra Application

*Applies to: [Application Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator) or [Application Developer](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-developer)*

Follow steps 1-10 outlined [here](/graph/data-connect-quickstart?source=recommendations&tabs=NewConsentFlow%2CPAMMicrosoft365%2CAzureSynapsePipeline&tutorial-step=2) to create your app service principal. Be sure to store the app secret to use in a later step in this process.

### 4. Enable MGDC for tenant

*Applies to: Global Administrator*

1. Open a browser and sign in to your [Microsoft 365 Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal).
1. Under **Settings**, select **Org settings**. You may have to select **Show all** to see the **Settings** option. 
1. Under Services, select **Microsoft Graph data connect**.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step0401.png" lightbox="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step0401.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable the MGDC app for the tenant":::

   :::image type="content" source="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step0402.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to turn MGDC on or off":::

5. Select **Save**.

If you have already enabled MGDC, you will need to:

1. Clear **Turn Microsoft Graph Data Connect on or off for your entire organization** to disable Data Connect.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Refresh the page.
1. Follow steps 3-5 above.

### 5. Mark a Viva Insights query for export
*Applies to: [Insights Analyst](../../advanced/setup-maint/user-roles.md)*
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have the correct Insights Analyst role. Previous users of the legacy Workplace Analytics platform might have the "Analyst" role. To complete this process, you need the "Insights Analyst" role. Use [these steps](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-how-to-add-role-to-user#assign-a-role) to enable the Insights Analyst role.

1. Open a browser and sign in to the [Advanced Insights app](https://analysis.insights.cloud.microsoft).
1. To run a new query, in the **Analysis** tab, select **Start analysis** on a [Power BI template](../analyst/templates/introduction-to-templates.md) or [custom query](../analyst/person-query-overview.md). (If you already have query results to export, you can skip this step.)
1. On the left navigation menu, select **Query results**.
1. Once query results are available for a new or existing query, select the Azure icon to mark for egress.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step0501.png" lightbox="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step0501.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows marking query results for Egress":::

5. Select **Export to Azure**.

### 6. Register MGDC application

*Applies to: [Microsoft Entra Application owner](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/overview-assign-app-owners), with Insights Analyst role*

Use [these steps](/graph/app-registration#register-a-new-app) to register your app with Data Connect.

There are a few unique steps, however, that are specific to this process for dynamic loads. When filling out the registration info page, be sure to use these values:

* **Subscription** (required): Select a subscription in the tenant that will be used exclusively to filter the next four sections that relate to data destination configuration.
* **Resource group** (required): mgdc-app-resource (or select an existing resource group) 
* **Destination type**: Select **Azure Storage Account**
* **Storage Account** (required): Select the Azure Storage Account created in Step 2 
* **Storage Account Uri** (required): Select the Uri in the form: https://**[storage account name]**.dfs.core.windows.net/ (rather than the **...blob.core.windows.net/**) 
* **Application ID**: Select your App service principal from Step 1
* **Publish type**: Single-tenant

Also, when you specify the datasets that the app registration needs to query, for a dynamic Viva Insights dataset, the name should be: **VivaInsightsDataset_Report_v1_[Viva Insights query name]**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to edit properties or datasets associated with the app, [use these steps](/graph/app-registration#update-app-registration-entry).

### 7. Consent to application/dataset

*Applies to: Global Administrator (App approver must be different from the app developer)*

1. Open a browser and sign in to your [Microsoft 365 Admin Portal](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal).
1. Under **Settings**, select **Org settings**. You may have to select **Show all** to see the **Settings** option.
1. Select the **Security & privacy** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step07.png" lightbox="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step07.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows steps for consent":::

5. Double-click to select the app in the list, verify the dataset and column names, then select **Approve**.

   :::image type="content" source="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step0702b.png" lightbox="../images/dynamic-metric-load-step0702.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to approve the dataset":::

### 8. Deploy ARM template

*Applies to: Application Administrator or Application Developer, with Insights Analyst role*

Use [these steps](/graph/data-connect-templates-overview) to generate a quick start template to set up the data pipeline. Use [these steps](/microsoft-365/enterprise/m365-dr-workload-other) to select your region.

### 9. Execute pipeline

*Applies to: Application Administrator or Application Developer*
