# Ways of working report

The **Ways of working** report uses a template populated by Viva Insights data to conduct a broad diagnostic of a company’s collaboration patterns, meeting effectiveness, wellbeing, and coaching to uncover areas for improvement. The categories and pages in the report help you answer these business questions: 

* **Understand collaboration patterns**
    * How much time do employees spend using digital collaboration tools?
    * How much time do people spend in different collaboration modes?
* **Make meetings effective** 
    * How does the organization spend its meeting time?
    * How much time is going towards recurring meetings?
    * Is multitasking driven by habit or necessity?
* **Improve wellbeing** 
    * Are employees getting enough time to work on their core priorities? 
* **Encourage coaching and development** 
    * Are employees receiving sufficient manager 1:1 coaching time?
    * Are managers balancing oversight with employee autonomy? 

To populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Ways of working** query in Viva Insights.

## Report settings

After the **Ways of working** report is set up and populated with Viva Insights data in Power BI, view and set the following parameters on the **Settings** page:

* **Select the time period for the report** – Select the time period for which you want to view data in the report.  
* **Select an attribute to group data by** – Select the primary group-by attribute shown in all the report pages. You can change this attribute at any time and all report pages will show group values by the new attribute.
* **Select optional report filter** – To filter the measured employee population, you can filter by any selected organizational attribute, and then filter by any of the values for these attributes. If you use filters, the measured employees count will reflect a reduced number. Measured employees reflect the number of employees in the filtered population who were active during the specified time period. Active employees are those who’ve sent at least one email or Teams chat during a work week included in the current time period.
* **Exclusions** – Use the check boxes to:
    * Exclude employees who are likely non-knowledge workers (that is, those spending less than five hours per week in meetings, emails, and/or Teams calls and chats).
    * Exclude weeks that are likely holiday or paid-time-off weeks or weeks that individuals are on other types of leave.
* **Select the preferred language for your report** – Change the language for your report. 

After confirming the settings, check the number of measured employees to confirm this is the population you want to analyze.

Let's discuss in more detail.

### Understand collaboration patterns 

#### Collaboration baseline and after-hours collaboration

**How much time do employees spend using digital collaboration tools?**

Compare the average weekly collaboration hours for each person, by group, to after-hours collaboration. This information highlights how collaboration load is impacting after-hours work.

#### Collaboration modes

**How much time do people spend in different collaboration modes?** 

Explore, by group, the average number of hours per week that people are spending in:

* Meetings.
* Email.
* Teams chats.
* Teams unscheduled calls.

Toggle between total collaboration or after-hours collaboration. Understanding differences between how teams get work done can uncover both replicable best practices and areas of opportunity.

### Make meetings effective

#### Long or large meetings

**How does the organization spend its meeting time?** 

Discover how your organization spends its meeting time. On this page, view the percentage of time spent in the different meeting types by the number of invitees, including the meeting organizer, and duration. 

Analyzing meeting practices at the organizational level can help pinpoint sources of meeting overload, which you can then work to streamline. You might also identify groups with successful meeting practices the rest of the company could adopt.

#### Recurring meeting hours

**How much time is going towards recurring meetings?** 

Understand the time your organization spends in recurring meetings. We've broken out average time by meeting categories, like **Large and short meetings** and **Small and long meetings**. Large or long recurring meetings are easy candidates to streamline by reducing the number of invitees or the meeting frequency or duration.

#### Multitasking prevalence

**Is multitasking driven by habit or necessity?** 

View the distribution of employees by their average collaboration hours and average multitasking rate—that is, the percentage of meetings and Teams calls hours where they’ve multitasked. This analysis helps determine whether multitasking during meetings is because of habit or because people don't have enough free time during the workday to catch up on email outside of meetings. 

### Improve wellbeing 

#### Uninterrupted focus hours 

**Are employees getting enough time to work on their core priorities?**

Find out how much time people have to work independently by viewing:

* Average available-to-focus hours—that is, time without any scheduled meetings during working hours.

* Uninterrupted hours—that is, time without any scheduled meetings during working hours not interrupted by email, Teams chats, or Teams calls.

### Encourage coaching and development

#### Manager coaching time

**Are employees receiving sufficient manager 1:1 coaching time?** 

Learn whether employees are getting enough 1:1 manager coaching. This page shows the distribution of employees by how much monthly 1:1 time they get with their managers. 

#### Empower your workforce

**Are managers balancing oversight with employee autonomy?** 

View the distribution of employees attending the same meetings as their managers, along with their average monthly 1:1 meeting time with their managers. This information is compared across the company. 

Use this page to analyze different segments of manager behaviors (**Co-attending**, **Highly managed**, **Under-coached**, and **Coaching**) based on their rates of attending the same meeting as their reports and their 1:1 meeting time.

### Behavioral trends
