# Manager effectiveness report

The **Manager effectiveness report** uses a template populated by Microsoft Viva Insights data to analyze people-manager behaviors in your organization. HR analysts can use this analysis to measure behaviors and trends of people managers across four key themes within your organization: manager capacity, coach, empower, connect, and model.

Each theme includes insights about manager effectiveness and ways to help maintain or increase preferred leadership behaviors. Key metrics are used to deep-dive into each theme, along with a **Why this matters** interpretation and best practices recommended by industry experts.

To populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Manager effectiveness** query in Viva Insights.
