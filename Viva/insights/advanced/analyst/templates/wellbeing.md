# Wellbeing – balance and flexibility report

The Wellbeing – balance and flexibility report uses a template populated by Microsoft Viva Insights data to help you get insights into employee wellbeing across your company. This analysis can help you uncover opportunities to improve focus, work-life balance, flexibility at work, and employees’ sense of community.

With this report, you can visualize and explore the following top-level business questions asked by leaders:

* **Protect focus** – Do employees have enough time to focus, and are they using Viva Insights to help find that time?
* **Balance work and life** – Are employees able to protect personal time?
* **Handle urgency** – Can employees manage unexpected demands and proactively shift some to planned work?
* **Embrace flexibility** – Are employees adopting a flexible working schedule?
* **Take breaks**  Are employees able to mindfully disconnect?
* **Stay connected** – Are employees part of a community at work?

Each report page includes a **Why this matters** interpretation, **recommended actions**, and **metric definitions**.

To populate the report in Power BI, you’ll need to set up and successfully run the predefined **Wellbeing – balance and flexibility report** query in Viva Insights.

>[!Note]
>We updated this template on March 3, 2023. If you've used the **Wellbeing – balance and flexibility** report before this date, make sure you run a new query as described in [Report setup](#report-setup) so you can enable new insights.

|Setting|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|**Select the time period to measure**|Set the time period that you want to analyze. Note that the four-week trend information on the summary page won’t show if the selected time period is less than eight weeks.
|**Select an organizational attribute to view the report by**|Set the primary "group-by" attribute shown in all subsequent reports. You can change this attribute at any time and all subsequent report pages will group values by the new attribute.
|**Select optional filters to exclude employee groups**|To filter the measured employee population, filter by any selected organizational attribute, and then filter by any of the values for these attributes. If you use filters, the measured employees count will show a reduced number. Measured employees are the number of employees in the filtered population who were active during the specified time period. Active employees are those who send at least one email or Teams chat during a work week that's included in the current time period.
|**Exclude weeks marked with a holiday indicator**|Select this control to exclude unusually low collaboration weeks based on individual collaboration patterns. These low collaboration weeks usually occur when employees are taking time off from work.
|**Exclude non-knowledge workers**|Select this control to exclude employees who spend a weekly average of no more than five hours in meetings, emails, instant messages, and calls.  These employees are unlikely to be knowledge workers or they don’t use Outlook or Teams.

### Embrace flexibility and Take breaks pages

## About the report

The **Wellbeing - balance and flexibility** report includes the following report pages that help you identify your employees' wellbeing across the company.

### Protect focus

This topic contains three pages, which each focus on a different theme: overview, adoption, and impact.

#### Overview

**Do employees have enough time to focus, and are they using Viva Insights to help find that time?**

Get a baseline view of how much time employees have to focus and how much time they kept as focus time using Viva Insights. This page helps you understand whether employees are actively protecting non-meeting time for focused work. You can also access adoption and impact pages from this page.

#### Adoption

**Are employees using Viva Insights to set aside time for individual work?**

Learn how consistently employees kept focus time over the last four weeks, and whether they’re using a Viva Insights focus plan to book their time. Use this page to:

* Better understand how your company is adopting focus time.
* Discover groups who haven't enrolled in a focus plan but have a high potential to benefit from one.

#### Impact

**How are employees benefiting from protecting time in Viva Insights?**

Find out how focus time is positively impacting employees. Like the last page, this page shows the number of hours employees kept for focus time over the last four weeks, and how employees booked that time--that is, with or without a focus plan. 

Also, use this page to:

* Explore the impact of focus time on after-hours collaboration.
* Reduce meeting conflicts during focus hours by starting a shared no-meeting day plan. 

### Balance work and life

**Are employees able to protect personal time?**

To help understand after-hours working trends, view the:

* Average weekly after-hours collaboration for each employee.
* Distribution of employees by their after-hours collaboration.
* Percentage of employees who were active during the weekends at least once every four weeks.

When you understand employees' after-hours and weekend work behaviors, you might uncover opportunities to protect the boundary between work and personal life.

### Handle urgency

**Can employees manage unexpected demands and proactively shift some to planned work?**

To uncover how unexpected demands are managed in your company, and to unlock opportunities to shift some of these demands to planned work, view:

* The percentage of employees and work weeks involved in urgent collaboration.
* The impact of urgent collaboration on employees' after-hours collaboration patterns. 

This report defines urgent collaboration using the following keywords in the email subject lines or meeting invitation titles: "urgent," "immediately," "ASAP," "fire drill," "immediate action." You can also find this list of keywords in the report.

### Embrace flexibility

**Are employees adopting a flexible working schedule?**

Identify employees' flexibility at work by exploring these three key percentages:

* **Flexible start times** – Weeks where employees had at least one day of flexible start time.
* **Recurring time to disconnect** – Weeks where employees took at least one hour of recurring break each day.
* **Control active hours** – Weeks where employees limited their work activities to their expected working hours. Expected work hours are the hours employees plan to work. For example, if employees have a standard work schedule from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, their expected working hours for each day would be eight hours. 

This analysis offers insight into how employees are adopting flexible working schedules.

### Take breaks

**Are employees able to mindfully disconnect?**

Find out how well employees are able to disconnect from work, and identify groups who might experience burnout. View the percentage weeks employees spent in each of the following categories (arranged here from most to least active online):

* Always on 
* Long (non-stop) 
* Long (with breaks)
* Standard (non stop)
* Standard (flexible)
* Low activity

Also view a distribution of this information by organization.

* Average weekly meeting hours employees spent in small group meetings.
* Distribution of emails and chats by colleague type. 

This information offers insight into whether employees are forming communities and rapport at work.
