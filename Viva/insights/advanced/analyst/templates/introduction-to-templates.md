# Power BI report templates

The **Analysis** page in Microsoft Viva Insights includes a number of predefined Power BI templates that analysts can use to visually analyze workplace collaboration patterns and trends. A template prepopulates a custom query and selects the applicable Power BI charts to show the query results.

## Requirements for analysts

Before analysts can get to work, they’ll need to be assigned the **Insights Analyst** role in Viva Insights. A Microsoft 365 global admin assigns roles, and can learn more about this task in [Assign roles](/Viva/insights/advanced/setup-maint/assign-user-roles). For general information about user roles in Viva Insights, refer to [User roles](/Viva/insights/advanced/setup-maint/user-roles).

### Licensing notes

* To use analyst features, an employee needs only to have the **Insights Analyst** role assigned. They don’t need to have been assigned a Viva Insights license.
* The predefined templates available in the Analysis page require the use of the Power BI Desktop, December 2022 version or newer. You don’t need a license for Power BI Desktop; you can download it for free by going to [Getting started with Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/getting-started-with-power-bi/). If you have an earlier version of Power BI desktop installed, uninstall it before reinstalling the new version.
