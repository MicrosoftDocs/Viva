# Employee Retention Playbook for Viva Insights and Glint

This playbook provides an introduction on how to design, train, and interpret a predictive employee retention model using data from Viva Insights and Glint. It includes the principles of employee retention, the business scenarios of employee retention, and code examples in R and Python.

With this playbook, you can:

- Learn the principles and scenarios for using the model
- Combine and validate data from Viva Insights, Glint, and other sources such as employee attrition data
- Train and evaluate a random forest model that can predict employee attrition
- Interpret and communicate the results and insights from the model

## Why build an Employee Retention Model?

### Business context

The most valuable asset of a company is its people. Because hiring is costly and many hiring decisions tend to be wrong,[^1] [^2] retaining great employees is critical to business success.  

Employee attrition is the voluntary or involuntary loss of employees from an organization.[^3] It can have negative impacts on the organization's performance, productivity, morale, and profit.[^4] Therefore, it's important for organizations to understand the factors that influence employee attrition and identify groups with higher attrition risk.

Losing an employee is costly because employees produce more value for the company over time. Employers could spend between 30% to 400% of the employee’s annual salary to replace one,[^5] depending on the former employee’s skill set. Considering that one in three hires leave the company within two years, this quickly adds up.[^6] Therefore, having a model to determine how to increase employee retention is vital.  

### Machine learning

Machine learning algorithms can process and analyze employee and HR datasets to develop predictive models capable of forecasting the likelihood of voluntary attrition among employees, based on identified patterns and contributing factors. These models can help organizations take proactive measures to retain their valuable employees and reduce the costs and consequences of turnover.  

Our proposed model uses historical employee data, performance metrics, engagement surveys, and other relevant indicators to proactively identify groups at higher risk of attrition to create a more stable, engaged, and productive workforce.

### Benefits

There are many potential benefits to an organization that uses a retention or attrition model:

1. **Financial Savings**: Low turnover can lead to financial savings in areas like recruitment, benefits administration, and retirement plans, which are more cost-effective with long-term employees. And, costs associated with hiring, training, and productivity losses due to employee attrition can also be reduced.[^7] [^8] [^9] [^10]

2. **Employee Engagement**: Employees who feel valued and supported are more likely to be engaged in their work. This leads to higher levels of job satisfaction and overall performance. An employee retention model can help identify the issues that cause dissatisfaction and disengagement.

3. **Enhanced Productivity**: When turnover is addressed, there’s less disruption to workflows, resulting in higher overall productivity. An organization can avoid adding additional stress to current employees, thus improving productivity, by maintaining a manageable level of turnover.

4. **Knowledge Retention**: Long-term employees have valuable institutional knowledge. Organizations maintain critical expertise within the company by retaining them.

5. **Innovation and Creativity**: Long-term employees are often more comfortable taking risks and suggesting innovative ideas. When they feel secure in their roles, they’re more likely to contribute creative solutions.
