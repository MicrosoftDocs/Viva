# Cross-collaboration queries

Cross-collaboration queries help you learn more about how parts of your organization collaborate with others.  When you run a cross-collaboration query, your results show how pairs of individuals or groups interact.

To run a query about collaboration between two individuals in your organization (person-to-person query), refer to [Collaboration between individuals](./cross-collaboration-p2p.md).

Or, to analyze how individuals collaborate with groups, refer to [person-to-group queries](./cross-collaboration-p2g.md).

You can also analyze how groups invest their time and collaborate with other groups, through [group-to-group queries](./cross-collaboration-g2g.md).
