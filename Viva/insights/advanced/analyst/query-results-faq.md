# Query results FAQs

We've compiled answers for some questions you might run across while viewing your query results. 

## Meeting queries

### Q1. Why is a meeting's Accept count greater than its Attendee count?

A1. You might notice that more people accepted a meeting than attended it. This can happen for a couple of reasons:

* Some invitees accepted the meeting but then attended another meeting without changing their response.
* Some attendees are external or unmeasured, meaning they're not assigned a Viva Insights license.

### Q2. Why are meetings missing from my results?

A2. The query might not have had any attendees. If no one attended a meeting, Viva Insights removes that meeting from query results by default. 

### Q3. Why is data about the meeting organizer missing?

A3. If you don't see results for a meeting organizer, then that organizer has opted out of Viva Insights. Learn more about opting out in [Opt out of Viva Insights](../../personal/use/opt-out-of-mya.md).

### Q4. Why is the Subject column empty for a meeting?

A4. Your admin might have suppressed certain sensitive keywords. If a meeting title contained one of those keywords, then query results don't show that meeting title.
