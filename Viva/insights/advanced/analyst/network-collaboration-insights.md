# Uncover network collaboration insights

Cross-collaboration queries in Viva Insights help you learn about how parts of your organization collaborate with others. With [person-to-person](./cross-collaboration-p2p.md) or [group-to-group](./cross-collaboration-g2g.md) queries, for instance, you can see how pairs of individuals or groups interact.

But sometimes you may want to dive deeper, to learn about how multiple groups or larger units of your organization collaborate on a broad scale, across the company. These are referred to as network collaboration insights, and Organization Network Analysis (ONA), which provides an in-depth perspective into the inner workings of an organization, is typically utilized to perform this type of deeper analysis.

ONA measures how people communicate and information flows across your company. With it, you can identify key collaboration patterns and acquire insights such as:

* Cross-group collaboration behavior

* Groups of employees who are showcasing increased tendency towards insularity, or more within-group collaboration behavior who overtime could become siloed

* Groups or teams who are acting as “central hubs” controlling or directing the flow of information across the collaboration network

By learning about these trends, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of organizational communication, and collaboration. And, once equipped with these insights, business leaders can make better informed decisions in support of business objectives.  

To start, you can use the ONA **Change management** analysis. With this ONA query, you can uncover how large-scale organizational changes such as reorganizations or post-merger integration have impacted collaboration patterns across the company.

These types of company changes can sometimes have unintended impacts on communication between teams, creating silos, limiting knowledge sharing, or slowing down the development of products and services.  

With the Change management template, you can measure the impact of these types of changes, to uncover essential insights into the repercussions of the change on collaboration behavior. This way, you can stay ahead of any emergent communication or collaboration issues that might impact business performance, and ensure that the change initiative is aligned with your company’s broader goals.
