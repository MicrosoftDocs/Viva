## Overview

Each of these steps takes place within one section of the [advanced insights app's](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2201482) **Custom queries > Person query** page.

>[!Note]
>If you're an existing Viva Insights customer, refer to the note in the [Introduction](../introduction-to-advanced-insights.md) for more information about using the new platform.

To run a person query, you'll follow five basic steps:

1. Set up your query.
1. Add metrics.
1. Add conditions and condition groups.
1. Add employee attributes.
1. Run your query.

In this article, we talk about how to complete each of these steps, and also give some important background information about how metrics, conditions, and attributes work.

## Set up your query

*Section: **Query setup***


The following steps are optional. We describe default values below.

Under **Query setup**:

1. Name your query. Queries are assigned a default name, which follows this format: Query type, user ID, date, and time. Make sure the name is unique.
1. Select a **Time period**. This field defaults to **Last 3 months**, but you can select another time period you want your query to analyze. Pick from **Last 1 year**, **Last 6 months**, **Last 1 month**, or a **Custom** date range. If you choose a **Custom** date range, use the date picker to select the range.
1. Set the query to automatically update by selecting the **Auto-Refresh** box. When you select the auto-refresh option, your query automatically runs and computes a new result every time Viva Insights gets updated collaboration data for licensed people. This option is deselected by default, but you can select it on any query where the **Time period** isn’t customized.

    >[!Note]
    >If the organizational data used in an auto-refreshing query changes (for example, an attribute name is altered or an attribute is removed), you might see an error when you run the query.
      
1. Type a **Description**.
   
1. Set how the query is grouped. By default, custom person queries are grouped by **Month**. To change this setting to **Week**, select **More Settings** beneath the **Description** box.

    Selecting **More Settings** brings you to the **More Settings** pane. Along with **Group by**, this pane shows the metric rules that apply to your query. To find out more about metric rules that apply to your query, select **See metric rule details**.
       
    >[!Note]
    >Metrics are criteria used to measure the productivity and wellbeing of employees, and metric rules are rules Viva Insights uses to improve the accuracy of your query results.
>
> To learn more about metrics used in Viva Insights, refer to [Metric definitions](../reference/metrics.md). To learn more about metric rules, refer to [Metric rules](./metric-rules.md).

### Add metrics 

*Section: **Select metrics for what you want to know about your employees***

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RW1lda0]

1. Under **Select metrics for what you want to know about your employees**, select the **Add metrics** button.

1. The **Add metrics** button brings you to the **Select metrics** pane. Using the check marks and the tools described later in this section (filter, search, and groupings) select the metrics you want to use in the query, then select **Add to query**. [Learn more about advanced insights metrics](../../advanced/reference/metrics.md).
   
   The **Add to query** button adds these metrics into your query and takes you back to the setup screen. The metrics you selected appear as tags in the box beneath the section description. 
   
   :::image type="content" alt-text="Select metrics section, with selected metrics appearing as tags" source="../images/person-query-selected-metrics-tags.png" lightbox="../images/person-query-selected-metrics-tags.png":::

3. You can also add Microsoft 365 Copilot metrics to your custom person query. These metrics provide insights around how employees are using Microsoft 365 Copilot with Microsoft 365 apps, and they’re part of your .csv output file.

    [Learn more about the Microsoft 365 Copilot metrics that you can use for your query](../../advanced/reference/metrics.md#microsoft-365-copilot-metrics).

#### About metrics

Metrics are criteria used to measure the productivity and wellbeing of employees. For example, if you’re wondering how much time employees spend collaborating after their working hours, you could use the **After-hours scheduled call hours** and **After-hours chat hours** metrics in your query.

##### Select metrics pane

###### Metric categories

In the **Select metrics** pane, metrics are grouped by *metric category*. Expand the categories to see which metrics they contain. Let’s say you were looking for the **After-hours scheduled call hours** and **After-hours chat hours** metrics in our earlier example. You’d find them in the **After-hours collaboration** metric category.

###### Filters, keyword search, and more information

There are a few other ways you can find metrics to include in your query. You can filter by type (for example, **Activity count metrics** or **Meeting metrics**) on the left side of the pane, or use the search bar to find metrics by keyword. If you're working with [Power BI templates](./templates/introduction-to-templates.md), use **Filter by Power BI templates** to pick metrics used in particular reports.

To find out more about a metric, hover over its information icon.

### Add conditions and condition groups

*Section: **Select which employees you want to include in the query***

1. Underneath the predefined "Is Active" filter, select the **Add condition button**, then select **Organizational data**.

   :::image type="content" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add condition button." source="../images/person-query-add-conditions.png" lightbox="../images/person-query-add-conditions.png":::

2. Using conditions and condition groups, add one or multiple filters to narrow your analysis of employees.

   >[!Note]
   >
   >The default conjunction for conditions and condition groups is “and.” To select “or” instead, use the dropdown menu.

#### About conditions and condition groups

A condition is a statement about one attribute you want to analyze in your query. A condition only extracts rows from your organizational data that meet certain criteria, which you specify in the condition statement. For example, if your condition statement read, “Organization = Contoso.com,” the query would only extract rows that equal Contoso.com” under the **Organization** column. A condition group is a combination of conditions connected with a conjunction ("and" or "or"). In the following image, the condition group is in the block to the right of the conjunction "or."

:::image type="content" alt-text="Condition group" source="../images/person-query-condition-group.png" lightbox="../images/person-query-condition-group.png":::

To learn more about filters and conditions, refer to our [Filters](filters.md) article.

##### Is Active

The app predefines one condition for you: “Is Active.” If you leave this condition set to “true,” the query only analyzes *active employees*. Active employees send at least one email or Teams chat during the unit of time—day, week, or month—defined by the query’s **Group by** setting.

When you open your query results file, you'll see a Boolean value of "TRUE" or "FALSE" in the **IsActive** column for each row. 



#### Total and measured employees

Beneath the **Add condition** and **Add condition group** buttons, you’ll see a number for **Total employees** and **Measured employees**. These numbers represent how many employees could be measured and how many employees the query is actually measuring, respectively. Checking these numbers before running your query can help you determine whether you’ve selected the right conditions and condition groups.

### To move and delete conditions and condition groups

To move a condition or condition group, take the following actions:

1. Select the six-dot icon to the right.
1. Drag the six-dot icon above or below other conditions or groups.
  
   To delete a condition or condition group, select the trashcan icon to the right.
    
   :::image type="content" source="../images/meeting-query-move-condition.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selected metrics in the box beneath Select metrics for what you want to know about your meetings.":::

### Add employee attributes

*Section: **Select which employee attributes you want to include in the query***

1. Select the **Select attributes** button, then on the right pane, use the checklist to make selections.
1. When you're done picking attributes, select the **Add to query** button.
    
   Attributes appear as tags in the box above the **Select attributes** button.

   > [!Note]
   > If an attribute appears as a red tag, that attribute might have been removed or renamed. You might see red tags if you’re cloning or editing a query and the attributes have changed since the query was last run. You can remove these marked attributes to get the query to run properly.


#### About employee attributes

Employee attributes are the data fields—or columns—that you’ve uploaded in your employee data. In **Select which employee attributes you want to include in the query**, you narrow down which data fields your query includes—for example, **Job level** or **Hire date**—to prevent your output (.csv) file from being larger than necessary. Making selections here:

* Improves data analysis with fewer columns in a smaller file.
* Further protects private data by excluding columns from the file.
* Enables you to select **Clear all** to clear the selected columns.

## Run the query

Select the **Run** button in the screen’s upper right to run the query.

### To access your query results

After your query runs, access its results on the **Query results** page, where you can also edit and clone your query. For further information, refer to [Access query results and modify existing queries](./query-results.md).

## Example person query for after-hours communication

Let’s say you wanted to run a custom person query to find out how often managers are emailing and sending Teams chats after their working hours. You want to:

* Analyze your company’s “West” organization only, which is provided in your employee data.
* See data for the last six months, grouped by month.
* Exclude Senior managers from the query.

Here’s how you might do that:

1. Set up your query.
   1.  **Query name**: Give your query a custom name by typing in something like “AfterHoursWest.”
   1. **Time period**: Select **Last 6 months**.
   1. **Auto-Refresh**: You just want to have this run once, so leave the **Auto-Refresh** box deselected.
   1. **Description**: Other analysts in your organization might want to know more about this query, so give it a brief description.
   1. **More settings**: You want this query to be grouped by month, not week. Select **More settings**, then change **Group by to Month**.
1. Add metrics.
   1. Under **Select metrics for what you want to know about your employees**, select the **Add metrics** button.
   1. Because you want to add metrics about collaboration after hours, expand the **After hours collaboration** metric category. 
   1. Select the **After hours email hours** and **After hours instant messages** metrics.
   1. Select the **Add to query** button.
3. Specify the employees you want to analyze.
   1. Under **Select which employees you want to include in the query**, leave the "Is Active" filter set to “true.“
   1. Select **Add condition**.
   1. Select **Organizational data**.
   1. Select **Organization**, leave the **Operator** at “=,” and select an employee organization of your company from the dropdown list. As we identified earlier, you’d select “West” from this list. 
   1. Select **Add condition group**. You don’t want to include Senior managers in this query, so:
      1. Select **Level designation** from the **Organizational data** dropdown.
      1. Leave the **Operator** at “=.”
      1. If you want, you can use the search bar to help find titles with “Manager.” Select Manager, Sales manager, and Design manager from the dropdown list.
   1. Check the **Total employees** against the **Measured employees**. If this number seems off, adjust your conditions above.
1. Choose the employee attributes you want to include in your output file.
   1. Under **Select which employee attributes you want to include in the query**, select the **Select attributes** button.
   1. From the right pane, select **PopulationType**.
   1. Select the **Add to query** button.
1. Run the query. On the upper right of the screen, select the **Run** button.
1. After the query successfully runs, find its results in the **Query results** page. To:
   1. Download the .csv output file: Select the CSV icon from the **Downloads** column. If you want to connect the query to another file, like a Power BI visualization, you can select the copy link icon.
   1. **Edit**, **Edit query name**, **Clone**, **Favorite**, or **Delete** the query: Select the ellipses to the right of the **Downloads** column, then select the appropriate choice. 

   > [!Caution]
   > Editing queries overwrites existing results. If you want to keep your query’s results, use the **Clone** feature—which creates an identical copy of the query—instead.

   >[!Note]
   > Only the analyst who originally ran the query can **Edit query name**, **Edit**, or **Delete** the query. Other analysts in the organization can **View**, **Clone**, and **Favorite** the query.
