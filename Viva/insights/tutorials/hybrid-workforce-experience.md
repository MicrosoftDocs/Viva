# Hybrid workforce experience dashboard

## Introduction

As leaders figure out their organization’s new working models, the Hybrid workforce experience Power BI dashboard helps them understand how hybrid work affects employees differently. The dashboard identifies opportunities to improve the experience of employees working in the following ways:

* Mostly onsite
* Mostly remote
* Onsite some days of the week and remote on others (hybrid)

This dashboard has six sections, which each address different facets of the employee experience that hybrid working models may impact. Key metrics provide a deep-dive into each topic, along with a **Why it matters** interpretation and **recommended actions**.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run queries and populate the dashboard in Power BI, make sure you:

* Are assigned the role of [Analyst](/viva/insights/use/user-roles?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) for Viva Insights

* Have installed the latest version of Power BI Desktop
  * Have the June 2022 or newer version of Power BI Desktop installed. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version. Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to download and install the latest version.

* Have the following attributes uploaded as part of your organizational data:
  * **OnsiteDays**, an attribute identifying the number of days someone works onsite. This could be based on behavioral data such as badge data or Wi-Fi data, or other sources such as a tag in the HR system identifying the number of days an employee *intends* to work onsite. You might get this data in one of two ways—through a weekly update of onsite days or by using a monthly update of onsite days to calculate the weekly number:
    * If an employee’s number of onsite days is available on a weekly basis (that is, values are between 0 and 5), make sure to include a row with an **EffectiveDate** and **OnsiteDays** value per person per week in your organizational data. You can choose the frequency with which you like to update this data—weekly or monthly.
    * If you’re using an employee’s number of onsite days per month, you can upload the monthly number of onsite days in Viva Insights on a monthly basis.
  * **SupervisorIndicator**, an attribute indicating whether someone is a manager.
  * **HireDate**, an attribute indicating the person’s hire date is required to be able to load the New hire onboarding insights. Without this attribute, however, the rest of the report will still load.

For further details on Organizational data preparation and upload, download our  [step-by-step guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2195632).

You can add new attributes to your organizational data at any time.
For more details on how to add new data for existing employees, review the documentation on [subsequent uploads](/viva/insights/setup/upload-organizational-data2?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Set up the template

>[!NOTE]
>
> This dashboard is currently only available in English and only works with data generated from the English version of the app. Before completing the following steps, confirm that the browser language contains **en-us** in the app's URL ("...office.com/en-us/...").

1. In [the app](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/)(if that link doesn't work, try [this link instead](https://workplaceanalytics-eu.office.com/)), select **Analyze** > **Query designer**.

2. In **Create** > **Other templates**, select **Hybrid workforce experience**, which takes you to required setup steps.

       Screenshot that shows the "Other templates" window within Query designer. On the left-hand pane, "Query designer" is highlighted beneath "Analyze." Beneath "Other templates," there are nine templates presented as cards. The last template card, "Hybrid workforce experience," is highlighted.  
    :::image-end:::
    In the second setup step, select **Set up** next to **Hybrid workforce experience** (if repeating this process per step 8 below, select **Strong and diverse ties**).
3. When prompted, select or confirm the options for **Group by**, **Time period**, and **Meeting exclusions**.
4. In **Select metrics**, keep the preselected metrics (these are required for the template to work).
5. In **Select filters**, select **Active only** for **Which measured employees do you want to include in your query results**? Optionally, you can further filter the employees in scope for the dashboard. For more details about filter and metric options, refer to [Create a Person Query](/viva/insights/Tutorials/person-queries?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json).
6. In **Organizational data**, add the attribute that specifies someone’s number of onsite work days (for example, **OnsiteDays**), the attribute that indicates whether someone is a manager (for example, **SupervisorIndicator**), and the HireDate. Add any other attributes you want to be able to use in the dashboard. For best performance, select no more than seven attributes.
7. Select **Run** (located in the upper right) to run the query, which can take between a few minutes and a few hours to complete.
8. When prompted, select to return to the **Query designer**. Repeat preceding steps 2-7, except this time, select the **Strong and diverse ties** query. Make the same selections that you did for the Hybrid workforce experience. Skip step 6; there's no need to include any organizational attributes in this Strong and diverse ties query.
9. When prompted, select to go to **Results**. After both queries successfully run, navigate to **Query designer > Results**. Select the download icon for the **Hybrid workforce experience** query results, select **PBI template**, and then select **OK** to download the template.

## Customize the dashboard

After the **Workforce experience** dashboard is set up and populated with Viva Insights data in Power BI, you’re prompted to map the following attribute values:

* **Mostly onsite** –  Select the number of onsite days that define the work mode of employees that work mostly onsite (that is, from the company’s main worksite).
* **Hybrid** – Select the number of onsite days that define the work mode of employees that work onsite some days during the week and remote on others.
* **Mostly remote** – Select the number of onsite days that define the work mode of employees that work mostly remote (that is, from home or some other location outside the company’s main worksite).
* **Individual contributor** – Select the attribute values that identify employees as individual contributors who do not manage people within your organization.
* **Manager indicator** – Select the attribute values that identify managers who manage people within your organization, like **Mgr** and **Mgr+**.

    :::image type="complex" source="../images/wpa/tutorials/hwfe-a-couple-of-questions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pop-up window in Power BI prompting users to assign onsite days to attributes and values to Individual contributors and Managers":::
       Screenshot that shows a pop-up window in Power BI, titled "A couple of questions to get you started..." There are two sections; the first section is titled, "Customize work mode definitions" and the second section is titled, "Select which values identify individual contributor and managers. In the first section, there is a slider with values 0 and 5. Beneath those values are a "Mostly remote: <1.1" label to the left, a "Hybrid: 1.1-3" label in the middle, and a "Mostly onsite: >3" label on the right. The slider is between "Mostly remote" and "Mostly onsite"; a value on its left is "3.1."  In the second section, there are two fields, and each also contain a dropdown menu to their right: "Individual contributors," which shows "All" in the dropdown menu, and "Managers," which also shows "All" in the dropdown menu.
    :::image-end:::

After this initial prompt, you can then select **Settings** in the upper right of any page to adjust the work mode mappings and view and change the following attribute values:

* **Select the time period for the dashboard** – Select the time period for which you want to view data in the dashboard.
* **Select an attribute to group data by** – Select the primary group-by attribute shown in all the report pages. You can change this attribute at any time and all reportages will show group values by the new attribute.
* **Select optional report filter** – Select the organizational attribute and values by which you want to filter employees in the dashboard.
* Exclusions – Use the check boxes to:
  * Exclude employees who are likely non-knowledge workers (that is, those spending less than five hours per week in meetings, emails, and/or Teams calls and chats).
  * Exclude weeks that are likely holiday weeks.

To adjust the individual contributors and managers mappings, navigate to **View > Bookmarks** in the ribbon. Underneath **Summary page**, select **Intro_ON** to reopen the initial prompt.
