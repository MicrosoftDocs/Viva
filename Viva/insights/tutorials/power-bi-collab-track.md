# Ways of working tracker

The Power BI Ways of working tracker uses Viva Insights data to help you, as an analyst track changes in collaboration over time and helps you target opportunities to improve employee wellbeing, meeting culture, and manager effectiveness.

This dashboard helps you track how collaboration is affecting the key performance indicators (KPIs) for employees by answering the following business questions.

* **How have the KPIs evolved over time?** – Shows trends for the key indicator categories, including average values for the most recent week’s top collaboration metrics.
* **How have KPIs changed in the last week?** – Shows how collaboration in the key indicator categories have changed from last week’s rolling average as compared to the   previous weeks’ rolling average.
* **How do organizations compare?** – Shows the collaboration averages per week for each organizational group for each key category.
* **Have any key scorecard metrics changed?** – The scorecards for each of the key indicators show weekly averages by organizational group and the percentage change from the baseline to the current time period.
* **Are trends moving in the right direction?** – The trend pages show how the key indicators are changing over time, including improving manager coaching and reducing after-hours work, lengthy, bloated, and meetings attended by employees and their managers.

The dashboard also includes an **Example interventions** page that has ideas on how to drive positive change with best practices based on industry insights and research. The **Glossary** page describes the metrics used in the different reports.

To populate the dashboard in Power BI, you must set up and successfully run the predefined **Ways of working tracker** query in the advanced insights app. The query results will refresh your downloaded Power BI dashboard on a weekly basis.

>[!Note]
>The template and dashboard name has been changed from Collaboration tracker to Ways of working tracker.

## Demonstration

This uses sample data that is only representative of the dashboard and might not be exactly what you see in a live dashboard specific to your organization's unique data.

To find the template for the Ways of working tracker dashboard, go to the [Query designer](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/en-us/Analyze/QueryDesigner/NewQuery)(if that link doesn't work, try [this link instead](https://workplaceanalytics-eu.office.com/en-us/Analyze/QueryDesigner/NewQuery)). For complete steps, see [Set up the dashboard](#set-up-the-dashboard).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the queries and populate the dashboard in Power BI, you must:

* Be assigned the role of [Analyst](/viva/insights/use/user-roles?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) in the advanced insights app.
* Have the latest version of Power BI Desktop installed. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version. Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to download and install the latest version.

## Set up the dashboard

>[!Note]
>This dashboard is currently only available in English and will only work with data generated from the English version of the app. Before running the required queries, confirm the browser language in the app's URL includes **en-us**, or change it to include **en-us**: ...office.com/en-us/...

1. In [the app](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/)(if that link doesn't work, try [this link instead](https://workplaceanalytics-eu.office.com/)), select **Analyze** > **Query designer**.

   * **Meeting exclusions** - Select the preferred rule for your tenant

   >[!Important]
   >If you try to delete a predefined metric, you'll see a warning that the deletion might disable portions of the Power BI dashboard and reduce query results. In turn, this can limit your ability to visualize collaboration patterns. Depending on the metric you delete, you might disable a single Power BI chart, several charts, or all the charts. Select **Cancel** to retain the metric.

4. In **Select filters**, select **Active only** for **Which measured employees do you want to include?** Optionally, you can further filter the employees in scope for the dashboard. For more details about filter and metric options, see [Create a Person Query](/viva/insights/tutorials/person-queries?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json).
5. In **Organizational data**, keep the preselected **Organization** and **LevelDesignation** attributes that the dashboard requires. You can then select any additional attributes (columns) that you want to include in the reports.

   >[!Important]
   >LevelDesignation is a reserved optional attribute when uploading your organizational data. If this attribute was not uploaded and is unavailable in the advanced insights app, charts and data relating to LevelDesignation will not show in the query output or in Power BI reports.

6. Select **Run** to run the query, which can take a few minutes to complete.
7. When prompted, select to go to **Results**. After the query successfully runs, select the **Download** icon for the **Ways of working tracker** query results, select **PBI template**, and then select **OK** to download the template.

## Dashboard settings

After the Ways of working tracker dashboard is set up and populated with Viva Insights data in Power BI, as a first step to viewing data in the dashboard, view and set the following parameters on the **Settings** page.

* **Earlier time period** - This is the baseline for your analysis and all changes will be compared with this time frame.

    >[!Note]
    >The **Earlier time frame** must precede and not overlap with the **Current time frame**. If the two timeframes overlap, you'll get a warning about the timelines overlapping.

* **Current time period** – This is the time period you want to compare with the earlier time period.
* **Organizational attribute to view the report by** - The primary “group-by” attribute shown in all subsequent reports. You can change this attribute at any time and all subsequent report pages will show group values by the new attribute.
* **Organizational attribute to filter by** – To filter the measured employee population, you can filter by any selected Organizational attribute, and then filter by any of the values for these attributes. If you filter, the measured employees count will reflect a reduced number. To clear an existing filter, select **Ctrl** while clicking the **Clear filter arrow** (or with a touchscreen, select the **Clear filter arrow**). Measured employees reflect the number of employees in the filtered population who were active in the specified time period. Active employees are those who sent at least one email or instant message in the work week included in the current timeframe.

After confirming the settings, check the number of measured employees to confirm this is the population you want to analyze.

Under **Select trendlines to display** at the upper right of the page, you can select to show only one or both averages in the charts.
* **How have KPIs changed in the last week?** – Shows how collaboration in the key indicator categories have changed when comparing the most recent week’s four-week rolling average with the previous rolling average. The colors of the number represent a change between the current week and the four-week rolling average. In **Filter Organization**, you can select one or more organizational groups to include in the data and the chart. In **Filter Metrics**, you can select a metric to view in the chart.
* **How do organizations compare?** – Charts the weekly collaboration averages for each organization by category. In the **What to watch** for section for each chart, explains how to interpret the chart data.
* **Have any key scorecard metrics changed?** – The scorecards use colors to represent the percentage changes or trend directions for the current time period as compared to the previous time period, which you set on the **Settings** page. **Green** represents a positive change, **yellow** represents no change (or less than a five percent negative change), and **red** represents a negative change in the percentage or trend. The following scorecards list the weekly averages and their change percentages, which are based on the comparison of the weekly current period average with the previous time period.

* **Are the KPIs trending in the right direction?** – The charts on the left of these trend pages show how the different key indicators are trending by comparing weekly averages between the different organizational groups for the current time period. The charts on the right compare how the averages have changed between the current and baseline time periods. Each trend page also includes a **Why it matters** section that explains why the indicator is important to analyze.

  * **After-hours trends** – Charts the weekly averages by organization for after-hours collaboration as compared to collaboration that occurred during working hours for the current time period. The other chart compares how employee averages by organization for after-hours collaboration have changed between the current and baseline time periods.
  * **Lengthy meeting trends** – Charts the weekly meeting averages for hours spent by organizational groups in lengthy meetings as compared to non-lengthy meeting hours spent in the current time period. The other chart shows how the averages have changed between the current and baseline time periods by organizational group.
