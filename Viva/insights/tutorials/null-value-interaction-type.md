# Null values after filtering the Teams channel metric

In the **Teams channels** metric, you can filter by a property calledÂ "Interaction type." Workplace Analytics doesn't restrict which values for "Interaction type" you can pick, but certain values will only result in null values for all employees in the query:

* Channel messages sent where Interaction type = "Reaction" or "Channel visit"
* Channel message hours, After hours channel message hours, or Working hours channel message hours where Interaction type = "Reaction"

For more information about the **Teams channels** metric, refer to [Advanced insights metric filters](../use/metric-filters.md#teams-channel-metric-filters)
