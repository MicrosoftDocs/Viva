# Templates in Query designer

The Query designer in the advanced insights app that's available with Viva Insights includes a number of predefined templates that analysts can use to visually analyze workplace patterns and trends. A template pre-populates a custom Viva Insights query and selects the applicable Power BI charts to show results from these queries.

## Requirements for analysts

[!INCLUDE [Requirements for analysts](../includes/analyst-requirements.md)]

## Power BI dashboards

The Query designer has templates for the following Power BI dashboards for visually analyzing data in Power BI. Select one to see more details about it and to view an interactive demo.

>[!Note]
>Most of these dashboards are currently only available in English and will only work with data generated from the English version of the advanced insights app. Before running the required queries, confirm the browser language in the app's URL includes **en-us**, or change it to include **en-us**: ...office.com/en-us/... (Business continuity and Microsoft Teams insights are the exceptions that support the same [languages as Viva Insights](../overview/supported-languages.md#supported-languages).)
