# Behavior patterns for Glint

>[!Note]
>This dashboard currently only supports Glint reports that are in English. For example, if you are a customer with data in Japanese, export the Glint report in English before you upload it to PBI. If you encounter errors even with the report exported in English, delete and then manually type in the column headers in English.

The Behavior patterns for Glint dashboard uses a template to combine sentiment data from Glint with behavioral data from Viva Insights. Leaders get insights into underlying factors that might be contributing to both how their employees feel and how they work. The analysis helps identify opportunities to influence behavior and improve business outcomes.

This analysis uses survey scores and working patterns to identify outlying teams who might need attention. Even for leaders who are already aware of team issues, the dashboard creates high-level visibility enabling them to use research-based and data-driven actions to change or improve workplace behaviors.

The dashboard combines the following data.

|Theme |Representative Glint survey question |Viva Insights metrics |
|------------|------------|------------|
|Wellbeing |My company takes a genuine interest in their employees' wellbeing. |<ul><li>After hours metrics</li><li>Burnout risk</li><li>Focus hours</li></ul>|
| Connection | I feel a sense of belonging at my company. | <ul><li>Internal network size</li><li>Small group meeting hours</li></ul>|
| Clarity | My manager keeps our team focused on clear priorities. | Manager one-on-one hours |
| Empowerment | I feel empowered to make decisions regarding my work. | <ul><li>Co-attendance rate</li><li>Time in self-organized meetings</li></ul>|
| Growth | I have good opportunities to learn and grow at my company. |<ul><li>Internal network size</li><li>External network size</li><li>Time in skip-level collaboration</li></ul>|

<!-- SWITCHING TO NEW IMAGE STYLE. FORMERLY HERE:

The dashboard includes the following reports.

* **Wellbeing** &ndash; Compares wellbeing scores for the selected HR attributes, such as organization or level designation, and shows how after-hours work, focus hours, and burnout risk might be affecting wellbeing for specific teams. You'll also see research-based, actionable strategies to help change behaviors that might be contributing to low wellbeing scores.
* **Connection** &ndash; Compares employee connection scores for the selected HR attribute to show how small group meeting hours and internal network size might be affecting employees’ feeling of connection. Helps leaders identify and support teams who might have underlying conditions that are affecting both their connection scores and collaboration patterns.
* **Clarity** &ndash; Compares prioritization scores for the selected HR attribute to show how manager one-on-one time might be affecting employees’ ability to focus on and prioritize their work. Gives teams easy-to-implement plans that create opportunities for employees to more regularly meet with their managers one-on-one and prioritize their work.
* **Empowerment** &ndash; Compares empowerment scores for the selected HR attribute to show how manager co-attendance and time in self-organized meetings might affect employee empowerment. Helps leaders understand how meeting behaviors impact autonomy and effectiveness.
* **Growth** &ndash; Compares growth scores for the selected HR attribute to show how network sizes and time in skip-level collaboration might affect team growth scores. It reveals the impact of network size and leadership interactions on development.
* **How can I take action to improve employee experience?** &ndash; Summarizes opportunities to improve employee experience by addressing related behaviors for individual, collective, and environmental interventions. After any interventions are started, leaders can use Viva Insights data to measure real-time change in collaboration behaviors and track improvement with subsequent Glint survey scores.

## Demonstration

This uses sample data that is only representative of the dashboard and might not be exactly what you see in a live dashboard specific to your organization's unique data.

## High-level steps

The high-level steps required to populate the dashboard in Power BI:

1. [Get Glint data](#get-the-glint-data) &ndash; In Glint, select the corresponding survey questions and the population to analyze in Power BI, including the HR attributes you want to analyze, such as team and position. Then export a Heat Map report file with this data.
2. [Get the Viva Insights data](#get-the-viva-insights-data) &ndash; Set up the predefined **Behavior patterns for Glint** template in the advanced insights app. After the results successfully run, download the template for the Glint query on the **Results** page. This template is required to create the dashboard in Power BI.
3. [Load both into Power BI](#load-the-data-in-power-bi) &ndash; Connect to and load both the query data from the advanced insights app and the Heat map from Glint into Power BI.

## Prerequisites

The following is required before you can run the query in the advanced insights app and populate the dashboard in Power BI.

* Your company uses Glint with the same measured population that the advanced insights app has data for:

  * The population reflected in the Glint Heat Map report is the same as the filtered population in the Behavior patterns for Glint template.
  * You have Glint survey content for the last three to six months that includes questions on one or more of the following themes of employee wellbeing, connection, clarity, empowerment, and growth.

* Be assigned the role of Analyst in the advanced insights app.
* Have the latest version of Power BI Desktop installed. If you have an earlier version of Power BI installed, uninstall it before installing the new version. Then go to [Get Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-bi-desktop/9ntxr16hnw1t?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to download and install the latest version.
* Have at least one of the following organizational attributes already uploaded and processed in the advanced insights app.

  * **Level designation** - Each employee's level in the organization.
  * **Organization or team** - Each employee’s team assignment, which reflects the organization or business division they're in.

## Get the Glint data

1. In Glint, select **Reports** > **Heat Map**, and then select the reports that have questions on wellbeing, prioritization, and connectivity. If the questions spread across different pulse dates, select the **Multiple Pulses** option.

Select **Cancel** to retain the metric.

4. In **Select filters**, select **Active only** for "**Which measured employees do you want to include?**" and then, optionally, you can further filter for the population of interest for the dashboard.

5. In **Organizational data**, keep the preselected **Organization** and **LevelDesignation** attributes that the dashboard requires and up to three more that match up with the attributes included in your Glint data.

   >[!Important]
   >If you remove the required, preselected **Organizational data** attributes, you might disable one or more Power BI charts.

6. Select **Run** to run the query, which can take a few minutes up to a few hours to complete.
7. When prompted, select to go to **Results**. After the results successfully run, select the **Download** icon for the **Behavior patterns for Glint** query results, select **PBI template**, and then select **OK** to download the template.
