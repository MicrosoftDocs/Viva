## Calculations

The following are the percentage insights, their underlying metrics, and a little about the calculations used for them.

![Develop effective managers percentage insight example.](../images/wpa/use/develop-managers-percent.png)

| Behavior | Percentage insight | Metrics | Calculations |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------ |
|Optimize meeting hours |Percentage of your managers' meetings that are structured around decision making |[Long and large meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#large-meeting-define) and [meeting hours](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-hours-define) |The percentage of managers who spend over 50 percent of meeting hours in long or large meetings. Long meetings are longer than one hour and large meetings have more than eight attendees. The percentages are calculated weekly and averaged for the entire time period. |
|Prevent burnout |Percentage of managers who are working after hours for more than one hour each week |[After-hours collaboration](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#after-hours-collaboration-define) |The percentage of managers who spend more than one hour collaborating through email, calls, instant messages, and meetings outside of working hours. This percentage is calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period. |
|Strengthen management pipeline |Percentage of employees who have the potential for managerial roles |[Influence](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#network-metrics) |Employees who are currently in non-managerial roles with influence scores greater than or within 10 percent of their immediate manager’s influence score. |
|Promote coaching and development |Percentage of employees who have less than 15 minutes of 1:1 time with their managers each week |[Meeting hours with manager 1:1](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-hours-with-manager-1-1-define) |The percentage of employees who spend less than 15 minutes of coaching time with their managers each week. To account for different frequencies in coaching, this percentage is calculated monthly and then divided by four for the weekly average. |
|Empower employees |Percentage of employees who have a majority of their meetings attended by their manager |[Meeting hours with manager](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-hours-with-manager-define) and [meeting hours](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-hours-define) |The percentage of employees who spend over 50 percent of their meeting hours with their manager in attendance. This percentage is calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period. |
|Foster connectivity |The percentage of managers who have limited cross-group connections |[Diverse ties](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#network-metrics) |The percentage of less-connected managers is based on the number of diverse ties they have outside their skip-level manager’s organization and compares that with the total number of managers in the measured population. This percentage is calculated weekly and averaged over the last six months. |

The following defines the organizational data shown in the visual behavioral insights.

![Develop effective managers visual insight example.](../images/wpa/use/develop-managers-visual.png)

| Behavior | Visual insight | Definitions |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
|Optimize meeting hours |Manager meetings by duration and number of attendees | Shows the percentage of [manager meetings](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-hours-with-manager-define) based on their type, including: [Large meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#large-meeting-define) with more than eight attendees, [long meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#long-meeting-define) that are longer than one hour, [long and large meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#long-and-large-meeting-define) with more than eight attendees and are longer than one hour, and [decision making meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#decision-making-meeting-define) with between two and eight attendees and are less than one hour in duration. These percentages are calculated weekly and averaged over the entire time period. |

## Best practices

This section describes why each of the following behaviors matter and the top best practices that can help managers be more effective.

* [Prevent burnout](#prevent-burnout)
* [Strengthen management pipeline](#strengthen-management-pipeline)
* [Promote coaching and development](#promote-coaching-and-development)
* [Empower employees](#empower-employees)

### Optimize meeting hours

Long and large meetings are costly and often a waste of manager time. Shorter and smaller meetings provide the best conditions for effective decision making.

[The condensed guide to running meetings](https://insights.office.com/collaboration/how-to-run-effective-meetings-and-stop-wasting-time/) explains a few new ideas that can help make your meetings more effective, such as if "you want people to have the opportunity to contribute, you need to limit attendance." Ways to optimize meetings:

* Use [Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes about decisions and action items as an alternative way to keep your team informed.
* Use [Manager insights within Advanced insights](../manager-insights/introduction.md) to help identify ways to support team behavior.

For more best practices and how to set team meeting rules and policy, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).

### Prevent burnout

Pressure to "always be on" and long hours can lead to burnout. The amount of time managers spend collaborating outside of business hours is an indicator of burnout risk.

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/): "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together." Ways to support wellbeing:

* Use [Quiet time](../personal/teams/quiet-time.md) to view after-hours activity and encourage disconnection from work after the day is done.
* Use the [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../personal/Use/mya-notifications.md#schedule-send-suggestions) to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.

For more best practices and how to define and share working hours, see [Best practices for wellbeing](../tutorials/gm-wellbeing.md).

### Strengthen management pipeline

Potential influencers are often difficult to discover within an organization. Employees who are well-connected and play an important role in sharing information throughout the organization may be effective leaders.

The [Measuring your employees’ invisible forms of influence](https://insights.office.com/productivity/measuring-your-employees-invisible-forms-of-influence/) article says that "traditional organizational reporting structures limit managers’ visibility into how their employees are influencing and contributing to other teams. New workplace metrics are needed to help leaders get a more complete picture of this." Ways to leverage influencers:

* Use personal network insights to cultivate influence and the [Teamwork](../personal/teams/teamwork.md) tab to see connections, top collaborators, and suggestions on how to improve connections.
* Move cross-functional team collaboration to Microsoft Teams and ask influencers to create [Channels in Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) for cross-functional team collaboration and to drive the conversations.
* Consider employees with high potential, not just top performers. Attributes that have contributed to past success may not predict future success. Broaden measures used to identify leaders to include those that assess potential, such as influence ranking.

For more best practices and how to identify and utilize influencers, see [Best practices for influencers](../tutorials/gm-influencer.md).

### Promote coaching and development

Manager one-on-one (1:1) time can improve engagement and job performance, while lack of manager coaching can cause employee disengagement and attrition. According to the research referenced in [What great managers do daily](https://insights.office.com/productivity/what-great-managers-do-daily/): "A Gallup study found that at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores is driven by who the boss is."

One of the top best practices for promoting coaching and development is to require that managers schedule recurring 1:1 meetings with their direct reports for 30 minutes at least twice a month and hold them accountable for achieving that goal. See [Catch up with your team](../personal/use/use-the-insights.md#catch-up-with-your-team) for help with scheduling and managing your 1:1s.

For more best practices and how to develop a 1:1 conversation series, see [Best practices for manager coaching](../tutorials/gm-coaching.md).

### Empower employees

Cultivating autonomy and development are essential for employee engagement. When managers empower employees to make decisions and tackle new challenges, enables them to be more effective and reclaim time.

[How to boost your team’s productivity](https://insights.office.com/productivity/how-to-boost-your-teams-productivity/) explains that "helping your team manage its time well is a critical factor for its success." Ways to increase information sharing:

* Use [Teams and OneNote](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-onenote-notebook-to-teams-0ec78cc3-ba3b-4279-a88e-aa40af9865c2) to share meeting notes about decisions and action items as an alternative way to keep your team informed.
* Use [Manager insights within Advanced insights](../manager-insights/introduction.md) to identify ways to support team behavior.

For more best practices and how to set team meeting rules and policy, see [Best practices for meetings](../tutorials/gm-meetings.md).

### Foster connectivity

Managers who have diverse ties across an organization are typically considered more effective and help their employees build strong networks.

In the [Empowering your employees to empower themselves](https://insights.office.com/management-strategy/empowering-your-employees-to-empower-themselves/) article: "Your employees understand their jobs. They know their tasks, roles, and functions within the organization, and it’s time for you to let them do what they need to do to get the job done." Ways to foster connectivity:

* Create cross-team communities for people with similar interests to share ideas, knowledge, and resources. This can also be done using [Teams channels](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
* Enable and use the [Viva Insights Outlook add-in](../personal/use/use-the-insights.md) and [Teamwork](../personal/teams/teamwork.md) to add colleagues to your **Important people** list, receive suggestions to meet, reminders to respond to emails, and complete tasks for these contacts. And urge your team to do the same.
* Create a shared [Teams channel](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview) to strengthen connectivity through channel interactions about projects, strategic topics, and goals to enable information sharing, brainstorming, and team building.

For more best practices and ways to open your network to your team, see [Best practices for manager connectedness](../tutorials/gm-connectedness.md).
