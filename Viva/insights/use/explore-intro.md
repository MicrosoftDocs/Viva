# Explore the stats

Explore the stats data in Viva Insights gives you a starting point with quick insights about your organization and to identify data you'll want to investigate further.

The following are available in Viva Insights:

* [**Week in the life**](/viva/insights/use/explore-metrics-week-life?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) summarizes day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
* [**Meetings overview**](/viva/insights/use/explore-metrics-meetings-overview?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) summarizes meeting norms within your organization.
* [**Management and coaching**](/viva/insights/use/explore-metrics-management-and-coaching?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) summarizes collaboration between leaders, managers, and employees.
* [**Internal networks**](/viva/insights/use/explore-metrics-internal-networks?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) shows network connections between different people within a company.
* [**External collaboration**](/viva/insights/use/explore-metrics-external-collaboration?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) summarizes employees' network patterns with people outside the company.
* [**Teams collaboration**](/viva/insights/use/explore-metrics-teams?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) shows communication trends about how your employees use Teams for communication and collaboration.

## Access to Explore the stats

You can access Explore the stats data through the recommendations within **See your insights** in the [**Take action**](insights.md#take-action) section of a relevant behavior.

For example, to see **Meetings overview** data in Viva Insights:

* Select **Home** > **Improve agility** > **Organize better meetings** > **See your insights** > **Explore the stats** in **Try shorter and smaller meetings**

* Open [Meetings overview](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/en-us/Home/Agility/MeetingsOverview). (If that link doesn't work, try [this link instead](https://workplaceanalytics-eu.office.com/en-us/Home/Agility/MeetingsOverview).)

## Data time limit

The historical data that populates **Explore the stats** is time limited; the charts reflect data that is no older than six months. This six-month period is a _rolling window_ that's based on when the [Microsoft 365 data](/viva/insights/use/office-365-data?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) refreshes. After a data refresh, the six-month extent of data reflected in **Explore the stats** advances by one week.
