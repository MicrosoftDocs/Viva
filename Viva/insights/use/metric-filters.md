# Advanced insights metric filters

To customize the results from [queries](/viva/insights/tutorials/query-basics?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json), you use metrics (see [metric definitions](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json)).

After you select a metric for a Viva Insights query, you can narrow the focus of that metric by applying filters. You can also rename the metric to indicate the new focus that you gave when you applied filters; its new name will appear in the query results. See [Apply a metric filter](#apply-a-metric-filter).

## Participant filters

Filters of the following types can be used in various query types to filter participants in collaboration activities &ndash; that is, in emails, IMs, calls, or meetings.

### Individual participant filters

| Filter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Description |

## Apply a metric filter

In this example procedure, you apply a filter to a metric in a person query. Specifically, you restrict the _Email sent_ metric to include only email that was sent during a particular time of day. Then, for the population of employees that you specify, the query results will show the number of emails that were sent during the time of day that you selected.

1. In **Analyze** > **Query designer**, select **Get started** under **Query**, and then select the type of query you want to create.

2. Under **Select metrics**, select **Emails sent**:

   ![Select emails sent.](../images/wpa/use/emails-sent.png)

3. Select edit (the pencil icon):

   ![Select pencil to edit.](../images/wpa/use/emails-sent-edit-pencil.png)

4. Under **Emails sent where**, select **Add filter** and then select **Email**:

   ![Select email.](../images/wpa/use/add-filter-email.png)

5. Next to **Email's**, select **Time of day**:

   ![Select time of day.](../images/wpa/use/email-sent-time-of-day.png)

6. In the adjacent fields, select "<" (before) and specify 7:00 PM.

   ![Sent before 7:00 PM.](../images/wpa/use/sent-before-7pm.png)

7. You have now filtered your base metric. You can optionally change the display name of this new filtered metric. In the field under **Display Name**, change **Emails sent** to **Emails sent before 7 PM** and then click outside the field to save the new name:

   ![Edit the metric name.](../images/wpa/use/edit-metric-name.png)

   After you run the query, the edited metric name will appear as a header in the query results:

   ![Edited metric name.](../images/wpa/use/edited-metric-name.png)
