# Power BI Connector metrics

The following base metrics are imported from Viva Insights into Power BI through the Power BI Connector. These base metrics are imported when you only enter a Partition Identifier and not any Query Names or Query Identifiers. For details, see [Connect through the Power BI Connector](View-download-and-export-query-results.md#connect-through-the-power-bi-connector). [Customized](/viva/insights/tutorials/customize-a-metric?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) or calculated metrics that are not available in Viva Insights as base metrics, show as **Not applicable** in the Viva Insights metric column.
