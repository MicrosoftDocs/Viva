# Employee experience

Microsoft Viva Insights has a **My team** page that shows manager's collaboration data about their team. The outcomes include data about **Employee experience**, which you can select in **My team** to see more details.

Research shows that happy employees help boost productivity and reduce turnover. These insights and suggestions can help you maintain positive employee experiences, such as evaluating how much time your team is working after hours on email or instant messages, and if your team is getting enough 1:1 time with you and other managers.

## Best practices

To see what actions are recommended, select **View best practices**. For example, in **Employee experience**, select **View best practices** to see what’s recommended for **Coaching and development**.

## About the insights

You can see more details about the insights by selecting the **Information** (i) icon next to the insight. The following describes how your team metrics are calculated to support these behavioral insights. With **Teams like yours**, you get comparable data from within your organization for context into broader organizational patterns. Today, "Team like yours" data is calculated as averages from peer manager teams. If you have only one peer team or no peer team, the company average is shown instead.
