# Internal networks

**Internal networks** shows network connections between different people exclusively within a company; for example, between the sales department and the human resources department.

## Access to Internal networks

**Internal networks** data is available through the recommendations within **See your insights** in the **Take action** section of a relevant behavior. Or you can open [Internal networks](https://workplaceanalytics.office.com/en-us/Home/ChangeManagement/InternalNetworks)(if that link doesn't work, try [this link instead](https://workplaceanalytics-eu.office.com/en-us/Home/ChangeManagement/InternalNetworks)) to view it in Advanced insights.

## Network size and network breadth

**Network size and network breadth** help illustrate whether employees are connected to a variety of other people, or whether they work in a more insular way, siloed within their immediate work group. A person's network health is also a key indicator of engagement.

## Employee connections and networks across the company

The **Network diversity** bubble chart shows how each organization in the company compares to the company median for network size and breadth.

* The quadrants of the chart are delineated at the median for both network size and network breadth.
* Bubbles represent organizations; the size of each bubble indicates the number of distinct measured employees in the corresponding organization.
* Placement on the chart is determined by the average network size and network breadth of people in each organization.

## Internal network size

**Internal network size** is the average number of people with whom a person has at least two [meaningful interactions](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meaningful-interaction-define). Network connections are measured on a rolling four-week basis.

### Why it's important

Network size is a consistent gauge of successful employees, regardless of their role or level. It can be an indicator of many things depending on the scenario and organization being analyzed.

Network size can indicate:

* The level of complexity required to accomplish a task.
* The levels of cross-function collaboration (high network size) or silos within a company (low network size).
* The success of onboarding programs for new employees.
* The success and speed at which acquisitions are integrated into a company.

## Internal network breadth

Internal network breadth is the average number of organizations an employee connected with (based on [meaningful interactions](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meaningful-interaction-define)) during the period selected.

### Why it's important

Network breadth can indicate:

* The level of complexity required to accomplish a task. A person connecting with more organizations can indicate higher complexity.
* The levels of cross-function collaboration (high network breadth) or silos within a company (low network breadth).
* The success of on-boarding programs for new employees by comparing newer employees to longer-tenured employees.
* The success and speed at which acquisitions are integrated into a company by comparing acquired groups to the rest of the company.
