# Advanced insights metric descriptions

To customize [queries](/viva/insights/tutorials/query-basics?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json), you can use the metrics that are defined on this page. They are organized by query type:

* [Person metrics](#person-metrics)
* [Peer comparison metrics](#peer-comparison-metrics)
* [Meeting metrics](#meeting-metrics)
* [Group-to-group metrics](#group-to-group-metrics)
* [Person-to-group metrics](#person-to-group-metrics)
* [Network metrics](#network-metrics)

## Person metrics

The metrics in this table are used both in [person queries](/viva/insights/tutorials/person-queries?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) and in [peer-comparison](/viva/insights/tutorials/comparison-query?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json) queries.

>[!Note]
>In Microsoft Teams, teamwork and communication happen in channels. Viva Insights includes several "channel metrics," which measure aspects of team communication over channels (both public channels and private channels) in Teams. These metrics are defined in the following table. When these metrics first become available in the advanced insights app in August, 2021, they will reflect a baseline of only 30 days of historical data; this historical data will increase as time progresses. This differs from other metrics, which usually have 13 months of historical baseline data.

<!-- BE SURE TO REMOVE THIS NOTE AT SOME POINT. ASK RADHIKA HOW LONG IT SHOULD BE RETAINED. 13 MONTHS FROM AUGUST 2021? -->

|Total emails sent during meeting | By the end of August 2021, this metric will be discontinued and unavailable for any future query data. Alternatively, for the same query results, use [Emails sent](/viva/insights/use/metric-definitions?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#emails-sent-define) and add the “Is sent during meeting” filter to customize that metric. |Person |Count |Yes |
|<a name="focus-define"></a> Total focus hours|Total number of hours made up of two-hour or more blocks of time where the person had no meetings. The new "Uninterrupted focus hours" metric is now available. It measures the total number of hours where a person has more than or equal to a one-hour block of uninterrupted time to focus on work during their set working hours. Uninterrupted time is when the person has no collaboration activity, including attending a meeting or an unscheduled Teams call, sending emails, or replying or sending an instant message or Teams chat. |Person|Hour|No|
| Working hours channel message hours | The number of hours that a person spent sending and reading posts and replies in Teams channels, during work hours. | Person | Hour | Yes |
|Uninterrupted focus hours |Total number of hours where a person has more than or equal to a one-hour block of uninterrupted time to focus on work during their set working hours.

|Working hours instant messages| Total number of hours a person spent time in instant messages through Teams, during working hours. | Person| Hour| Yes |
| <a name="workweek-span-define"></a> Workweek span | The time between the person's first sent email, meeting attended, or Teams call or chat, and the last email, meeting, call, or chat for each day of the work week. The total number of hours are based on the person’s work week that is set in Outlook, which the user can change at any time. If a work week is not defined in Outlook (or if the advanced insights app is unable to access a user's Outlook settings), the totals are based on the default of Monday through Friday, with a minimum of four hours and a maximum of 16 hours per day. If reported for the week, the metric is a sum of the daily values for the week. If reported for the month, the metric is the sum of the daily values for the month. |Person|Hour|No|

This counts both licensed and unlicensed employees in the collaborator group. |Group|Count|No|

## Network metrics

The following network metrics are based on the collaboration activities, including: emails, meetings, Teams calls, and Teams chats.

|Metric|Description|Query type|Data type|Customizable|
|------|-----------|----------|---------|------------|
| <a name="diverse-tie-score-define"></a> Diverse tie score | A numeric score that indicates how varied and how broad a person's connections are. This is based on both the infrequent direct collaboration between two people and on the differences in the common network they share between themselves. (Collaboration activities consist of emails, [meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-define), Teams [calls](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#call-define), and Teams chats.) <br>A person need not have much direct collaboration with their diverse ties, so it’s easy to have more diverse ties than [strong ties](#strong-tie-score-define). Diverse ties present good sources of fresh and varied information from across the company. | ONA | Score | No |
| <a name="diverse-tie-type-define"></a> Diverse tie type | A value that indicates the relative diversity of the person's diverse ties. 0 means that the tie is not diverse; 1 means that the tie is diverse; 2 is an intermediate value that means more diverse than 0 but less diverse than 1. (The Diverse tie type metric is derived from the [Diverse tie score](#diverse-tie-score-define) metric, which in turn is based on the thresholds that are described in [The last columns give the results](/viva/insights/tutorials/ona-person-to-person-query?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#the-last-columns-give-the-results).) | ONA | Score | No |
| <a name="diverse-ties-define"></a> Diverse ties | The number of diverse ties that the person has, that is, the number of ties whose [Diverse tie type](#diverse-tie-type-define) is 1. | ONA | Count | No |
| <a name="influence-define"></a> Influence |A numeric score that indicates how well connected a person is within the company. A higher score means that the person is better connected and has greater potential to drive change. (A person’s connection score is based on the frequency of collaboration activities, which include emails, [meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-define), Teams [calls](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#call-define), and Teams chats with other people within the company.) | ONA | Score | No |
| <a name="influence-rank-define"></a> Influence rank | One of a sequence of numbers that starts with 1. A rank of 1 represents the person with the greatest [Influence](#influence-define) score; a rank of 2 represents the person with the next greatest Influence score, and so on. If two people have the same Influence score, they also have the same influence rank. | ONA | Score | No |
| <a name="manager-overlapping-strong-ties-define"></a> Manager overlapping strong ties | The number of strong ties that are in common between a manager and their direct reports. If a manager shares a significant number of strong ties with their directs, this can indicate that they are on the same page and executing on a well known, well understood, common plan. This metric reflects the manager's ability to ensure that the team is working toward progress and team members are up to speed. | ONA | Count | No |
| <a name="manager-unique-strong-ties-define"></a> Manager unique strong ties | The number of strong ties that are unique in the manager's network when contrasted with the strong ties of their direct reports. This metric helps answer the question: "What is the potential of this manager to bring fresh connections and fresh ideas to their team?" | ONA | Count | No |
| <a name="strong-tie-score-define"></a> Strong tie score | A numeric score that indicates how strong and tight a person’s engagements are. It is based on both direct collaboration between two people and on the common network they share. (Collaboration activities consist of emails, [meetings](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#meeting-define), Teams [calls](/viva/insights/use/glossary?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#call-define), and Teams chats.) <br>For example, a "strong tie" between a manager and a direct report reflects both the amount of direct collaboration they have with each other and the time they both invest in connections that are common to both of them. Typically, a person has only a few strong ties because such ties take more effort to maintain. | ONA | Score | No |
| <a name="strong-tie-type-define"></a> Strong tie type | A value that indicates the relative strength of the person's strong ties. 0 means that the tie is not strong; 1 means that the tie is strong; 2 is an intermediate value that means stronger than 0 but weaker than 1. (The Strong tie type metric is derived from the [Strong tie score](#strong-tie-score-define) metric, which in turn is based on the thresholds that are described in [The last columns give the results](/viva/insights/tutorials/ona-person-to-person-query?toc=/viva/insights/use/toc.json&bc=/viva/insights/breadcrumb/toc.json#the-last-columns-give-the-results).) | ONA | Score | No |
| <a name="strong-ties-define"></a> Strong ties | The number of strong ties that the person has; that is, the number of ties whose [Strong tie type](#strong-tie-type-define) is 1. | ONA | Count | No |
