# Get support for Workplace Analytics Azure Templates

>[!Important]
>As of February 2022, this product is no longer being supported.

For general help with Microsoft 365 and Azure subscriptions, components, assigning licenses, and issues with user access and permissions, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/).

You can get scenario support specifically for Workplace Analytics Azure Templates only as part of an active Microsoft service engagement. Contact your service engagement representative to get help with the following.

* **Deployment support** â€“ Get help deploying the templates in your Azure subscription environment. Based on the agreed upon Azure environment access in your service engagement, you can get help deploying components or your Azure admin can get instructions to execute scripts, register apps, and other related deployment tasks.
* **Reliability support** - Depending on environment access, you can get help with specific deployed scenarios that use the templates to ensure they are operational and processing data correctly.
* **Sustainability support** - Depending on environment access, you'll get hot fixes or notification of available hot fixes to remediate any unforeseen issues. Any reported issue impacting the functionality of a scenario will be internally reviewed and triaged by an Azure Templates team to determine resolution time.
* **Updates and releases** - You'll get new major releases and updates with the latest capabilities based on your utilized scenarios. If the team does not have access to push updates to your environment, your delegated Azure admin will get notifications of new updates and releases.

>[!Note]
>If an issue occurs because of an underlying service or component that an Azure Template scenario uses, you might be referred to other Microsoft Support channels for escalation, such as a downed service or a failed data export.
