# Relationship Intelligence

_This template is only available as part of a Microsoft service engagement._

Workplace Analytics Azure Templates includes the Relationship Intelligence report for Power BI. You can use this report to analyze relationships your organization has with collaborators external to the company, such as relationships with customers or partners.

Workplace Analytics has a variety of measures to help you visualize and analyze formal and informal relationships within your organization. This report can help you understand how internal groups are communicating and spending their time with ***external*** collaborators.

This report uses account and contact information from a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, such as Dynamics or Salesforce. The CRM data provides account-level focus and insights into relationship patterns. If no account or contact data is available, it analyzes external domain-level collaboration as a proxy for accounts.

The Relationship Intelligence report includes a **General insights** section that shows how your employees are engaging with your customers and an **Account-specific insights** section about how your employees are engaging with a specific account.

![Relationship intelligence report introduction.](./images/ri-pbi-intro.png)

1. **How have we been engaging with our accounts?** – Shows what percentage of accounts your organization or select groups were meaningfully engaged with the defined group of accounts. It also shows a chart based on the average connectivity score by account group. When you select a group from the chart on the left, the chart on the right will change to show only the selected account data.
2. **How much attention are we investing in our accounts?** – Shows the level of investment in accounts based on the interaction type, including the total cost and number of hours invested in collaboration with the account over the selected time period. It also shows the average number of internal employees working with accounts. When you select a group to focus on, you’ll see their data highlighted in the charts.
3. **How are our internal groups engaging with accounts?** – Shows the average number of collaboration hours invested with accounts by internal groups and their time investment with accounts over the selected date range.
4. **How do accounts compare to each other by collaboration?** – Includes the following information as related to account collaboration activity, such as email and meeting hours spent with accounts and the last date the organization engaged with them. You can filter and focus the list by using the account name, account size, connectivity tier, and/or connectivity score.

   ![Relationship intelligence account comparison.](./images/ri-accounts-report.png)

   * The **Recent connectivity score** is based on the amount, frequency, and timeliness of collaboration activity with an account. The scores are divided into the following values that can be filtered into any combination.

     * Low: 1 to 29
     * Medium: 30 to 79
     * High: 80 to 100
  
   * The **Account size** filters are based on the estimated number of people in your organization who interacted with or contacted customer accounts. The sizes are divided into the following values that can be filtered into any combination.

     * XS: 1 to 2 contacts
     * X: 3 to 9 contacts
     * M: 10 to 49 contacts
     * L: 50 to 99 contacts
     * XL: 100 to 499 contacts
     * XXL: 500 or more contacts

   * The **Connectivity tiers** categorize each account into one of the following percentiles out of all of the accounts the organization engages with, which you can filter down to any combination of tiers.

     * Bottom 5 percent
     * Bottom 25 percent
     * Bottom 50 percent
     * Top 50 percent
     * Top 25 percent
     * Top 10 percent
     * Top 5 percent

   * The **Connectivity rank by account size** ranks each account by comparing its connectivity score with all the other accounts of a comparable size that your organization interacts with. You might see rank ties between one or more accounts who have the same connectivity score and the same size designation.

5. **What accounts or contacts are missing from our CRM system?** – Shows individuals assigned to an account but that are not in your CRM data. It also shows **Detected domains** that lists individuals included in the data who are missing or incorrect in the CRM or account data. You can select to filter the list by an account or an email address.
6. **Who are the contacts at an account and how are we engaging with them?** – For the selected account, you can evaluate the following:

   * See visuals about the average **Collaboration investment** and **Connectivity Score** and how the score has changed over the selected time and how metrics contributing to the score have changed over the last three months.
   * This page helps you see what type of communication has occurred with contacts over time and who the top individual account contacts are that the organization has collaborated with.
   * It also shows if the contacts you’re communicating with are in the CRM data or not.

7. **How are my internal groups spending time with accounts?** - For the selected account, you can see the top internal groups in the organization who have collaborated with account contacts per month. The **Group Engagement** chart shows the monthly total collaboration hours for the internal groups.
8. **How are we communicating with an account?** – Shows the following details about the selected account:

   * The **Connectivity score over time** chart shows how consistently the internal groups have communicated with the selected account from month to month. You can also see the metrics that were used to determine the connectivity score, including the number of contacts, their collaboration hours, and the recency of the collaboration with the account.
   * The other charts show collaboration trends by interaction type and how meaningful the interactions were over the selected time period.

9. **What are the main topics of discussion with an account?** – The **Topics** word cloud is based on subject lines for meetings and email. It shows the main topics that the account’s collaboration activity was focused on. Use the **Time range selection** to see how the topics in the word cloud change based on what date range is selected.

   >[!Note]
   >If your data does not include subject lines for meetings and email, the word cloud will be empty because of the lack of data.

10. **Which internal groups are collaborating with individuals from an account?** - Shows which groups are collaborating with the selected account. When you select a group, you’ll see the list of the individual account contacts that group collaborated with, including their email addresses, connectivity scores, titles, influence ranks, and other details.
11. **How are individuals from an account collaborating with us?** – You can select a specific account and an individual account contact to see how that person is collaborating with one or more of the organizational groups over the last three months. This page focuses on details, such as their most recent connectivity score, CRM status, job title, latest engagement date, and more details about how and how often they’re collaborating with internal groups.

## Steps to create the report

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - Confirm or complete all the prerequisites.
2. [Add an account mapping](deploy-configure.md#account-mapping) - Follow the steps to create a new account mapping file for Workplace Analytics Azure Templates.
3. [Add new analysis](#add-new-analysis) - Follow the steps to create the dataset in Workplace Analytics Azure Templates that the Power BI report uses.
4. [Load the data and view the report](#load-the-data-and-view-the-report) - Follow the steps to download the template and load the data in Power BI. You can then use Power BI to visualize the data and drill in and focus on account details.

## About the metrics

The following metrics are used in Relationship Intelligence.

|Metric |Description |
|-------|-----------|
|Connectivity Score |Geometric mean of the inverse of the Latest Engagement, the Total Collaboration Hours, and the Collaboration Participants divided by the number of internal and external people involved in the interactions. Normalized to control for the different account sizes, the score is higher for customers who have more participants and collaboration hours and were more recently contacted.  number of people, total time, and recency of communication between internal groups and external accounts. |
|Email Hours |Total number of hours spent collaborating in emails with an individual, group, or account. |
|Collaboration Participants|Total number of unique participants in an external domain that internal groups are directly connected with or the number of unique internal contacts that external individuals or accounts are interacting with depending on the report table. |
|Influence Rank |Indicates a group or an individual's potential influence on opinions of the network. Essentially, the number and strength of connections for a group or an individual. The values are between 0 and 1. The metric is exposed as a rank within a group where 1 is the most influential. |
|Latest Engagement |The most recent date where an external account or individual was contacted by an internal group. |
|Meaningful Connections |Within any given month, two individuals must have had at least two emails, two meetings, or one email and one meeting to count as a meaningful connection. Emails or meetings must have two to eight participants (including cc'd or bcc'd people). Meetings longer than eight hours or with over 550 participants are excluded. Also, meetings with keywords, such as party, vacation, sick leave, and so on, are also excluded.|
|Meeting Hours |Total number of hours spent collaborating in meetings with an individual, group, or account. |
