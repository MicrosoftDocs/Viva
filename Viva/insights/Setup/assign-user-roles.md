# Assign user roles for Viva Insights

People can work with Microsoft Viva Insights only after they've been assigned a role. See [Roles in Viva Insights](../use/user-roles.md) for details on what each role can do with Viva Insights. Refer to the following for assigning roles:

* [Assign Viva Insights roles](#assign-viva-insights-roles)
* [Assign advanced insights roles](#assign-advanced-insights-roles)
* [Assign roles to groups](#assign-roles-to-groups)
* [Verify role assignments](#verify-role-assignments)
* [Role assignment FAQ](#role-assignment-faq)

>[!Note]
>The Insights admin enables people managers access to [Group insights](../use/group-insights.md#admin-tasks) through [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md).

## Assign Viva Insights roles

**Owner** - [Microsoft 365 global admin](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles)

Do the following to assign users to a Viva Insights role, including the **Insights Administrator** and **Insights Business Leader** roles.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/home).
2. Go to [Role assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2097861).
3. Search for **Insights**, and then select the applicable Insights role to assign a user.
4. Select **Assign** > **Add**.
5. Enter the username, and then select the user from the list of suggestions. Optionally, add multiple users until you're done.
6. Select **Save**.

>[!Note]
>You will not be able to assign yourself to a Role; another admin must do this for you.

Within a few days after being assigned a Viva Insights role, these users will get an email about what product features are available based on their role and service plan.

## Assign advanced insights roles

**Owner** - Azure Active Directory [Application Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#application-administrator)

Do the following to assign users to an Advanced insights role, including the **Analyst**, **Analyst (Limited Access)**, and **Program Manager** roles.

1. To assign roles for advanced insights, sign in to your tenant's [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com).
2. In the left navigation menu, select **Enterprise applications**:

   ![Enterprise applications.](../images/wpa/setup/enterprise-apps.png)

3. In **Enterprise applications | All applications**, select **Application Type** > **All Applications**:

   ![Application types.](../images/wpa/setup/ent-all-apps-3.png)

4. In the search field, enter **workplace**, and then press **Enter**.
5. In the search results, select **Workplace Analytics** for advanced insights.  
6. In **Workplace Analytics** | **Overview**, under **Getting Started**, select **Assign users and groups**:

   ![Overview page.](../images/wpa/setup/wpa-overview.png)  

7. In **Users and groups**, select **Add user**.

   >[!Note]
   >In the **Users and groups** section, you'll see **None Selected**.

8. In **Add Assignment**, select **Users and groups**.
9. Under **Users and groups** (on the right side of the page), identify the user to whom you want to assign a role. Start typing that person's user identifier (such as their name or User Principal name) in the search field and then select their identifier in the results list. After you select the person, their identifier appears on the right under **Selected items**. In the **Users and groups** section, you'll see the selected user count change by 1:

   ![Add Assignment + 1.](../images/wpa/setup/add-assignment-plus-1.png)

   >[!Note]
   >Repeat this step to add one or more additional users to assign them the same role.

10. In **Add Assignment**, chose **Select Role** to view it on the right side of the page:

    ![Select role.](../images/wpa/setup/select-role.png)

    >[!Note]
    >The Group manager role might appear (as a disabled option) in some tenants that were provisioned earlier.

11. Select the applicable role. You'll then see the selected role at the bottom of the **Select Role** section. The role also shows up under **Add Assignment** in the **Select Role** section:

    ![Added role.](../images/wpa/setup/add-assignment-select-53.png)

    >[!Note]
    >To change the role for a user, repeat **Steps 10-11** and select a different role in **Step 11**.

12. In **Add Assignment**, select **Assign** (bottom of the page):

    ![Assign.](../images/wpa/setup/assign-button.png)

13. After a few seconds, you'll see a message in the upper right about the role assignment. Optionally, you can now assign additional roles, either to the same user or to different users by repeating these steps.

To check the current role assignments for a person, see [Verify role assignments](#verify-role-assignments). After people are assigned an advanced insights role, they will not receive an email notification from Viva Insights. As their admin, you'll need to notify them of what's available to them based on their role. To learn more about feature access for the different roles, see [Roles in Viva Insights](../use/User-Roles.md).

If you assigned the Microsoft Viva Insights (WpA transition) license to one or more people, they will also not receive an email notification. So you'll need to notify them as well. For details about this license option, see [Premium access for licenses assigned before July 2021](../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-admin-tasks.md#premium-access-for-licenses-assigned-before-july-2021).

## Assign roles to groups

You can also assign roles to groups, which means that you are assigning access permissions associated with that role to the group. Any people who are assigned to that group automatically receive the same permissions.

### Viva Insights groups

To assign Viva Insights roles to a group, the steps are similar to those for assigning roles to individuals, as described in [Assign Viva Insights roles](#assign-viva-insights-roles). In that process, when prompted to select a name, select a group name instead, and then assign a role to the selected group. For more details, see [Manage a group in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/manage-groups).

### Advanced insights groups

>[!Note]
>You can assign advanced insights roles to Azure Active Directory security groups. For more information about working with this kind of group, see [Manage app and resource access using Azure Active Directory groups](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups).

To assign roles to a group, the steps are similar to those for assigning roles to individuals, as described in [Assign roles](#assign-advanced-insights-roles). In that process, when prompted to select a name, select a group name instead, and then assign a role to the selected group.

   ![Select group.](../images/WpA/Use/select-group-b.png)

To learn more about creating a user group in Azure Active Directory, see [Create a group and add members in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal).

## Verify role assignments

Do the following to see what roles are assigned for Viva Insights:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/home).
2. Go to [Role assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2097861) to see a person or group's assigned roles.

Do the following to see what roles are assigned for advanced insights:

1. On the **Workplace Analytics | Users and groups** page, start typing the user or group identifier. As you do so, the list filters accordingly.  
2. In the **Role assigned** column, you can see the person or group's role assignments.

## Role assignment FAQ

**When to assign a group instead of an individual a specific role**

It depends on the situation and your company's policies. However, the primary reason for choosing between one method and another is usually efficiency. In a smaller company, if you only need to assign a few people a Viva Insights role, it's more convenient to assign individual people their applicable roles, especially if their roles are unlikely to change.

However, in a larger company where the number of people required for the same role is significant, such as for program managers, it is more efficient to assign the role to a group, and then add users to the group because groups are easier to manage and audit.

**How is the people manager role assigned**

People manager isn't technically a role that can be assigned. Assuming these managers also meet the prerequisites described in [Admin tasks](../use/group-insights.md#admin-tasks), the Insights admin can enable them access to their [Group insights](../use/group-insights.md#admin-tasks) through [Manager settings](../use/manager-settings.md) within the Advanced insights app.
