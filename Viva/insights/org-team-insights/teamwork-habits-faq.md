# Teamwork habits FAQ

Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about what you see in the **Teamwork habits** tab within Microsoft Viva Insights in Microsoft Teams.

##### Q1 Who benefits from Teamwork habits in Viva Insights?

Teamwork habits is designed for employees on working teams, and it derives insights from your personal Exchange Online mailbox.

Based on information you already have access to in Outlook and Teams, Viva Insights applies intelligence to this information to make it easier to:
 
* Reflect on your work patterns.
* Take action to improve team wellbeing and productivity.

##### Q2 What data does Viva Insights use for these insights? How does it protect that data?

Teamwork habits uses collaboration data from Microsoft 365 and—depending on your setup—uses organizational data that your admin has uploaded in the advanced insights app or that's in Azure Active Directory. All of this data is de-identified to maintain personal privacy in Viva Insights. See [Data-protection considerations](../advanced/privacy/privacy.md#data-protection-considerations) for more details.

##### Q3 Can you identify specific team members and see their personal collaboration habits in Teamwork habits?

No. Viva Insights generates Teamwork habits insights using each person's own data, which it computes from their email, meetings, calls, and chats. Individual employee data is stored and protected in the same way as the user's Microsoft 365 data. Specifying team members only sets the group of collaborators that Viva Insights takes into account when it computes your team habits.

##### Q4 Does the Microsoft Viva Insights app comply with GDPR?

Yes. The Viva Insights app complies with GDPR requirements.

##### Q5 How is my team defined and how can I change it?

The first time you open Teamwork habits, the app prompts you to select your team and other settings. After the initial setup, you can make changes to your team any time within **Settings**:

1. Select the **ellipsis** (...) in the upper-right of the Viva Insights app.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Select **Teamwork habits** to make changes to your team, and then select **Save**.

>[!Note]
>If you're a manger, Azure Active Directory suggests team members to you. After you make changes, the automatic sync from your organization’s directory will stop and you'll be responsible for keeping the list up to date.

##### Q6 Can I use Teamwork habits as an individual contributor?

Yes. As an individual contributor, you can follow the steps described in the previous question to set up your team. After you set up your team, you’ll find **Teamwork habits** within the Viva Insights app. The team insights will filter to match up to your currently selected team. 

##### Q7 While trying to access Teamwork habits, why am I prompted to allow Viva insights to process my M365 collaboration data?

>[!Note]
>Viva Insights processes this data as described in the [Privacy Guide](/viva/insights/personal/overview/privacy-guide-users).

If you see a message about reactivation, you've previously deactivated the setting that allows Viva Insights to generate insights based on your collaboration data from Microsoft 365. To access Teamwork habits, you need to reactivate this setting.

You can always undo this change later in **Settings** in the Viva Insights app.

##### Q8 How can I send Microsoft feedback?

For the "Is this helpful" question in the bottom-right corner of every page, select **Yes** or **No** to provide feedback. 

##### Q9 How do I opt back in to Teamwork habits?

You can opt back in at any time to Teamwork habits within Viva Insights Settings. Refer to [Teamwork habits documentation](teamwork-habits.md#disable-or-enable-teamwork-habits) for detailed steps.
