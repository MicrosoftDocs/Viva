# Organization trends FAQ

Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about what you see in **Organization trends** within the Microsoft Viva Insights app.

**Q1. Who benefits from Organization trends in Viva Insights?**

A1. **Organization trends** is designed for qualifying managers and business leaders with privacy-protected organizational insights based on usage of Microsoft 365.

Viva Insights applies intelligence to this information to make it easier for managers and leaders to see work patterns, then take action to help improve organizational productivity and wellbeing of the teams and organizations they're responsible for.

**Q2. What data is used in these insights and how is it protected?**

A2. These manager and leader insights use collaboration data from Microsoft 365 and depending on your setup, use organizational data that your admin uploaded in the advanced insights app or that's presented in Azure Active Directory. All of this data is de-identified to maintain personal privacy in Viva Insights. See [Privacy](../advanced/privacy/privacy.md) for more details.

**Q3. Does the Microsoft Viva Insights app comply with GDPR?**

A3. Yes. The Viva Insights app complies with GDPR requirements.

**Q4. How can I gain access to Organization trends?**

A4. You can gain access to an experience if you fulfill the requirements for that experience. To view the prerequisites for manager and leader insights, refer to [Setup](../org-team-insights/setup.md).

Here are a few common reasons why you might not be able to access **Organization trends**:

* **The required number of users might not have licenses assigned to them.** To make the **Organization trends** page available, a certain number of licenses need to be assigned to people in your organization. This number needs to be equal to or greater than your [minimum group size](../advanced/setup-maint/setup.md#minimum-group-size). The default minimum group size is 10, so at least 10 people in your organization need a license before you can access **Organization trends** for the first time.
* **You might not have enough reports.** Organizational hierarchy is based on Azure Active Directory data or an organizational data file, depending on your organization's settings. If that data shows the wrong hierarchy, you might not qualify to view **Organization trends**. You need to have at least as many reports as your [minimum group size](../advanced/setup-maint/setup.md#minimum-group-size). The default minimum group size is 10.
* **You might not be assigned a role, or might be assigned the wrong role.** You become eligible to view **Organization trends** in one of two ways:
    * Your Microsoft 365 admin or Insights Administrator assigns you the **Insights Business Leader** role. Refer to [Assign admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles) for more information about role assignment.
    * Your Insights Administrator enables you as a manager through the **Manager settings** page in the advanced insights app. Refer to [Manager settings](../advanced/setup-maint/manager-settings.md) for more information about enabling someone as a manager.
* **You might not have waited long enough after your Microsoft 365 admin assigned licenses.** After you assign licenses, give Viva Insights five days to process collaboration data so that you can access the **Organization trends** page and view your insights.

**Q5. How can I send Microsoft feedback?**

A5. For the "Is this helpful?" question near the end of every insight and every page, select **Yes** or **No** to provide feedback. You can also select the **Allow Microsoft to contact** checkbox if you’d like Microsoft to contact you about the feedback.

**Q6. How can I stay updated with the latest Viva Insights features and learn from peers who are using the tool for their organizational needs?**

A6. We encourage all Viva insights users to visit and register on the [Viva Insights community](https://community.vivainsights.microsoft.com/t5/Viva-Insights-blogs/bg-p/viva-insights-blog). The community has:

* Forums to connect with peers and discuss shared experiences.
