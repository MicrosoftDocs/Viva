# Organization insights in Viva Insights

Organization insights help leaders and managers of large teams understand how their organizations—the people who report to them directly or indirectly—are succeeding at work. Leaders and managers can see key indicators of their organization’s wellbeing, productivity, and team culture, and they can find features and tools to help support their teams.

## Subscriptions, roles, and access

To view organization insights:

* You need to have a premium Viva Insights subscription.
* Your Insights admin needs to assign you the [**Insights Business Leader** role](../advanced/setup-maint/assign-user-roles.md) or enable you as a [group manager](../advanced/setup-maint/manager-settings.md#to-configure-manager-settings) in Viva Insights. 
* You need to have a number of direct and indirect reports that meets or exceeds the [minimum group size](../advanced/setup-maint/manager-settings.md#to-configure-manager-settings) your Insights admin set. 

People in your organization also need to have a premium Viva Insights subscription so they can be measured in organizational insights. If you want to see an insight that reflects your entire company, everyone in the company needs to have a premium Viva Insights subscription.

### Insights by role

People with the **Insights Business Leader** role assigned to them can see organization insights that include every person in their tenant who has a premium Viva Insights subscription. 

People enabled as group managers can see organization insights that include people who report to them directly or indirectly. Your Insights admin maintains this reporting hierarchy. If your admin assigned you the **Insights Business Leader** role and also enabled you as a group manager, you can toggle between the two organization insights views.

## Data and privacy

Viva Insights commits that no user will discover information about another identified individual that they couldn't already know. This principle applies to every feature in Viva Insights, including organization insights.

For further detail about privacy and organization insights, refer to our [privacy information](../advanced/privacy/privacy.md#about-organization-insights).


## Using organization insights

Organization insights are more than just a dashboard—they also provide helpful features to share insights and actions with your organization. Here's what you might see when you open your Viva Insights app:

:::image type="complex" source="images/org-insights-all1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the organization insights section.]":::
   Screenshot of the "Your organization insights" section in the Viva Insights app. The image shows three insight cards. From left to right: "Uninterrupted focus hours," which is the largest, "Manager 1:1 meeting hours," and "Meeting hours." Elements of the organization insights section are labeled with numbers 1-5, which correspond to feature description labels below. 1 is the scope selector, currently labeled "Your organization," in the top right corner. The rest of the labels are on the "Uninterrupted focus hours" insight card. 2 is the indicators, placed next to the text, "14.1 hours per person last week." 3 is the "Show details" link next to the "Set up plan" button at the bottom left of the card. 4 is the share button at the bottom right of the card. 5 is the "Set up plan" button.
:::image-end:::

Let's take a look at how to use these features:

1. **Scope selector** 
    
    *Applies to: people who are enabled as a group manager **and** are assigned the **Insights Business Leader** role*

     At the top-right of any page or section with organization insights, an indicator shows how many people the insight is measuring. If you're enabled as a group manager *and* you have the **Insights Business Leader** role assigned, you can toggle between your reporting organization and the entire company.

    The measured group count reflects the number of people who report to you directly or indirectly, according to the reporting hierarchy maintained by your Insights admin, who also have Viva Insights premium subscriptions.  

1. **Indicators**

    Insight indicators show you your organization’s average for the most recent period available, and how much it has changed from the period prior. 

1. **Details**

    Insight details give you additional context for understanding the measured results. These details can include trend lines, peer comparisons, comparisons across groups within your organization, and distributions. When you select the **Show details** link, Viva Insights brings you to a separate page. Expand the following image for a sample view of a detail page.
    

    :::image type="complex" source="images/org-insights-detail-page-reg.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the insight detail page for Uninterrupted focus hours.":::
       Screenshot of the Details page for the "Uninterrupted focus hours" insight. The title of the page reads, "Uninterrupted focus hours" with an information icon. The subtitle reads, "Is there time for individual work?". Below the subtitle is a numerical indicator, as described earlier, with text about an increase. A description of the indicator sits below the indicator and contains an information icon. Below the description is a line graph. On the right of the screen is a card titled, "Block time for focus" that allows users to start a shared focus plan. The card contains a "Set up plan" button and "More actions" links. In the top right of the screen, there's a scope selector indicating that data is being shown for the organization.
    :::image-end:::

1. **Sharing** 

    Sharing is available for most insight cards. You can share an insight in one of two ways:
    * **In a Teams chat** – When you share through a chat, you'll send a screenshot of the insight to another person. You can add a message if you want. The chat contains a link so the recipient can go to their own insights.
    
        :::image type="complex" source="images/org-insights-share-chat1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows sharing an insight by chat.":::
           Screenshot of the "Share via chat" window. The title reads, "Start adding people to share." Beneath the title is a "Send to" field where users can add recipients. This field currently contains a recipient, showing their profile image and name, with an X button to cancel. Beneath "Send to" is a "Leave a note" field which includes user-entered text. Beneath "Leave a note," a box next to the text, "Include a preview of my own insight" is checked. In the bottom portion of the window, there's a "Preview" section that shows what the recipient will see. The message title reads, "Elvia Atkins shared insights with you." Below the message title, there's the note the sender wrote above. Part of the insight is visible in the preview. In the bottom right of the window, there's a "Done" button.
        :::image-end:::

    * **Through a link** – When you share through a link, that link takes the recipient to the same location in Viva Insights. Linking someone doesn't give them access to the same data you can see, but if they also have access to organization insights, they'll see results for their own group.

        :::image type="complex" source="images/org-insights-share-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows sharing an insight by link.":::
           Screenshot of copying an insight link. The image shows a checkmark and a label with the text, "Link to 'Uninterrupted focus hours' copied." Below the label is a web address field; this address field contains a direct URL to the insight. To the right of the address field, there's a "Copy again" button. In the top right of the window, there's an X button to close the window.
        :::image-end:::

1. **Actions**

    Actions point you to other workflows in Viva Insights that can help support you or your organization to manage a measured behavior. 

    Here's an example:

    Let's say an insight shows people's meeting time has significantly increased. The insight card might contain a button to set up a plan. When you select the button, Viva Insights takes you to the [no-meeting day plan](../personal/teams/shared-no-meeting-day.md) to help folks dedicate a full day to their independent work.

## Related information

### Helpful terms

* <a name="current-period-define"></a> **Current period** – Unless otherwise stated, most insights are showing the result for the most recent period—that usually means the most recent complete week of data. A few insights use a four-week or rolling four-week window instead, to smooth normal variability and make it easier to understand the insight. If an insight uses something other than the most recent week for the current period, you will see it called out on the insight card. 
* <a name="employees-define"></a> **Employees** – Organization insights provide measures for groups of employees, and are meant to capture what typical workday activity looks like for those employees. To avoid skewing the averages by including people who are not at work during the week (for example, they are on holiday or out sick), organization insights only measure people who have some activity in Outlook or Teams during the week.
* <a name="organization-breakdown-define"></a> **Organization breakdown** – The groups displayed in the organization breakdown are based on your reporting hierarchy. Each group includes people who report directly or indirectly to a person who reports to you. The insights represent the activity of the group, not just that person who reports to you, even though their name is used to label the group. 

    Insight Business Leaders who are viewing the insights for the entire company will see the organization breakdown by organizations reporting to top-layer leaders.
* <a name="peer-organization-define"></a>**Peer organization** – Peer organization includes groups near your own group in the reporting hierarchy. If available, the peer organization includes people who report directly or indirectly up to your manager, but not up to you. If there aren't any groups like this, or they don’t meet the minimum group size, the peer organization includes people who report directly or indirectly up to your skip-level manager but not up to you. If there’s not enough people who meet that definition either, you won't see peer organization insights. 

    Insights Business Leaders who are viewing insights for the entire company will also not see peer organization insights.
* <a name="prior-period-define"></a>**Prior period** – The prior period is the period immediately before the most recent period – usually the week before the most recent completed week. 
* <a name="reporting-hierarchy-define"></a>**Reporting hierarchy** – Your Insights administrator manages the reporting hierarchy. This hierarchy identifies reporting relationships throughout the company: people who are managers, and the people who report to them. The reporting hierarchy might be sourced from Azure Active Directory or from a manual upload from your company’s HR information system. Viva Insights uses this information to identify people in your organization, your peer organization, and any organizations that might report up to you.
* <a name="your-organization-define"></a>**Your organization** – If the insight scope selector says **Your organization**, this group includes everyone who reports to you directly or indirectly. This group is based on your organization’s reporting hierarchy, your Insights administrator manages. If the insights scope selector says **[Your company name]**, this group includes everyone who has been set up as part of the premium insights group by your Insights administrator.
