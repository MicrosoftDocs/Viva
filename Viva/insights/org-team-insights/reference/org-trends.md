## Group managers

As a qualifying people manager, Microsoft Viva Insights gives you visibility into leading indicators of the wellbeing, productivity, and experience for the groups in your reporting structure.

>[!Note]
>This reporting structure is defined by the organizational hierarchy confirmed by your company's Viva Insights administrator.

You can use these insights to understand current team norms and take action to create positive change. For details, refer to [Admin tasks](../../personal/teams/viva-teams-app-admin-tasks.md).

## Business leaders

As a business leader, Viva Insights gives you a snapshot of these same wellbeing, productivity, and experience indicators for your company at large. You can use these insights to understand company-wide norms and structural practices that influence how work gets done as well as opportunities to intervene for positive change.

## Admin tasks
