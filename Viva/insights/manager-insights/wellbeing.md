# Best practices for wellbeing

 More than 40 percent of creative ideas occur during breaks or when allowing your mind to wander. When employees regularly work after-hours, they can burn out. Employee burnout is a major cause of turnover, accounting for 20 to 50 percent of total attrition.

## Why it matters

Based on research presented in the [Why unplugging from work is more work than we think](https://insights.office.com/productivity/unplugging/) and [Help your team achieve work-life balance — even when you can't](https://insights.office.com/employee-experience/help-your-team-achieve-work-life-balance-even-when-you-cant/) articles, employees need to unplug:

* "New research and our growing understanding about human behavior tell us two things for certain: that unplugging is more necessary than ever, and that true unplugging is not a single action but a social agreement — a culture shift that employees and companies must create together."
* "[87] percent of HR leaders cited improved retention as a critical or high priority over the next five years, but 20 percent said they had too many competing priorities to focus on fixing the problem this year."
* "According to the recent study of 1,400 workers, nearly half of respondents said that thinking about work outside of work hours regularly has a negative impact on their work-life balance."

## Best practices

* Use data about [after-hours activity](../personal/teams/quiet-time.md) and encourage them to disconnect.
* Use [Inline suggestions in Outlook](../personal/Use/mya-notifications.md#schedule-send-suggestions) to automatically delay email delivery to align with coworkers' configured working hours.
* Alternate the time of global meetings to become more inclusive and minimize after-hours collaboration.
* Remind employees that the organization's success is based on a marathon, not a sprint.  
* Encourage team to take turns taking time off. This reinforces trust, collaboration, efficiency which can lead to better work satisfaction.
* Practice setting and keeping boundaries. Boundaries can result in better overall team outcomes.

## Change strategies

### Start a wellbeing plan

Enroll your team in a [Wellbeing teamwork plan](../tutorials/teamwork-solution.md). Plan participants will receive email digests, in-line suggestions, and actionable insights.

#### Define and share working hours

Add your working hours to your [Outlook email signature](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-an-email-signature-from-a-template-5b02c5ed-1e85-4d2a-a098-9628fe3231d8) and encourage your team to do the same to help manage the expectations of others. The following is an email signature example:

```
Cora Thomas
Program Manager
Redmond, Washington
My working hours are 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM PT
```

#### Create norm of scheduling "slack-time"

People often feel overloaded because tasks take more time than we expect. "Slack-time" is a block of time without meetings to accommodate unplanned tasks, to get work done, or decompress at the end of the day. Ways to do this:

* Send out communication regarding the importance of slack- or focus-time.
* Encourage people to block their calendars and actually decline meetings or email sent during that time.
* Share anecdotes around when people have successes by utilizing their slack-time.
