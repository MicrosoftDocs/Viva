Microsoft Viva Insights provides personalized recommendations to help you and your team do your best work. The app brings personal insights and manager insights in a unified experience, so that you have access to insights in your flow of work in Teams, the tool that you are already using for communicating with your team.

* **Suggested tasks** – Helps you stay on top of your collaboration with colleagues with AI-based task suggestions and meeting assistance. For details, see [Suggested tasks](../personal/teams/suggested-tasks.md).

* **Protect time** – Helps you reduce distractions, stop multi-tasking, and find time to focus on your core priorities. For details, see [Protect time](/insights/teams-app-use-insights#protect-time).
