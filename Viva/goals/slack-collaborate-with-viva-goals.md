# Introduction to Slack integration

Slack users can now leverage the Viva Goals app for Slack to bring OKRs into their daily tooling. The Viva Goals app enables quick and seamless integration with Slack so that your team can add and update their OKRs without ever having to leave Slack. Additionally, notifications in Slack ensure you never miss an OKR update again. 

Within the Viva Goals app, users now have the following capabilities within Slack: 

- **Get OKR updates** – Users timely receive OKR and project updates from a team, team member, or an organization
- **Check-in** - Users can make check-ins to their OKRs and projects.
- **Manage OKRs** - Users can create new OKRs or make edits to existing ones

## Configuring Slack Integration 

To link your Slack workspace with Viva Goals, navigate to Admin > Integrations > Slack in your Viva Goals account. Click on **Add to Slack**. Next, select the workplace from the top right corner of the page, and click on **Authorize**.

## Easily bring OKR and projects into conversations 

With the help of the Slack integration for Viva Goals, users can access better OKR previews and provide additional context to conversations without switching tools.
