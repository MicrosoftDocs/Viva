# Introduction to Microsoft Viva Goals app for Slack 

[Slack](https://slack.com/) users can now leverage the [Microsoft Viva Goals app for Slack](https://goals.microsoft.com/slack_bot/install) to bring OKRs into their daily tooling. The Viva Goals app enables quick and seamless integration with Slack so that your team can add and update their OKRs without ever having to leave Slack. Additionally, notifications in Slack ensure you never miss an OKR update again. 

Within the Viva Goals app, users now have the following capabilities within Slack: 

- **Get OKR updates** â€“ Users timely receive OKR and initiative updates from a team, team member, or an organization
- **Check-in** - Users can make check-ins to their OKRs and initiatives.
- **Manage OKRs** - Users can create new OKRs or make edits to existing ones
