# Jira Server and Data Center Integration

> [!NOTE]
> Tenant administrator must enable Jira Server integration from [Viva Goals tenant settings](vg-integrations-administration-overview.md) before it is visible on Viva Goals integration section on your Viva Goals organization.

Jira Server and Jira Data Center enables automatic tracking of OKR and Initiative progress in Viva Goals from Jira user-stories or Epics. Any updates on the linked Jira user stories, epics, or projects will automatically update the progress of linked Viva Goals KRs and Initiatives. This ensures your OKR process is not waiting on manual check-ins and any progress is updated real-time on Viva Goals.

## How to configure Jira Server or Data Center connection 

1. The first step in setting up the integration is to connect your Jira Server or Data Center account to Viva Goals. Navigate to your sidebar and click **Admin** and then click **Integrations**.
1. In the integrations section, go to Jira and then click on **Enable**. If Jira is already enabled, you’ll see a Manage button. Click on **Manage.** 
1. Click 'New Connection' and in the pop-up dialog box, add the following details:
    1. **Connection name:** Give your connection name.  
    1. **Server:** Add your Jira Server URL.  
    1. **How is this Jira instance hosted?:** select 'Jira Server' option.

## Current limitations of Jira Server and Data Center integration

- The automatic sync for the first time will happen within 10 minutes of connecting Jira with an OKR or Project and progress won’t be synced immediately in the first-time sync. However, you can also manually refresh to pull in all the updates by clicking on the Sync button in the integration pop-up.  
- Jira Server and Data Center integration will support progress computation based on Tickets count and Story Points
