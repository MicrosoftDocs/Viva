# Share an update using Goals Broadcast

Viva Goals users can share updates with their teams and stakeholders to keep others informed about goals and progress. You might share an update:

- Once goals have been finalized at the conclusion of planning, so everyone on your team is on the same page about what needs to be done.

- After a review meeting, so you can share progress, celebrate wins, and announce next steps.

- After important milestones, so stakeholders are aware of major progress.

## How to use Goals Broadcast

This feature is available to all licensed users in Viva Goals. Simply go to the goal list or dashboard for your team or organization and select **Share** > **Share an update**.

To complete your update, add a message for your team, choose who you want to receive notifications of your update, and select **Post**.

After you've posted the update, your chosen audience will receive an email. The email will include your message and a visual overview of the goals you shared. Your colleagues can react to or comment on the update directly from Outlook or in the Viva Goals **Updates** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> Private goals cannot be shared via updates. If a private goal is part of a goal list that is being shared, the private goal will be excluded from the email notifications and the visual in the **Updates** tab.

## Email notifications

You can customize the email notifications and audience for every update you post. By default, the update will be shared with all members of the team or organization you're sharing from.

- To customize who will receive email notifications, select the **Edit** icon underneath the goal list.

    Search for users, groups, or Viva Goals teams that are a part of your organization, then select (or deselect) the checkboxes next to the names of the ones you want (or don't want) to receive notifications.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Email notifications might not be sent to users who were added to the Viva Goals team via the admin dashboard less than 2 hours before the sending of the update.

- To disable notifications for your update, select the button to the left of **Post**.

## Edit or delete an update

You can edit or delete an update by going to the **Updates** tab and selecting the three dots next to the **Share** menu. You can only edit or delete updates that you authored. Deleting a post will permanently remove it from previously shared locations, including email notifications associated with it.
