# Planview Projectplace integration

## About Planview Projectplace integration 

The Viva Goals Planview Projectplace integration lets you link OKRs to your project boards for automatic real-time updates. 

Let's take this example: you have an objective to create an amazing user experience. You can directly link this objective with the project you're running in Planview, so whenever you make an update and move a card in your project board, your OKR status is updated automatically. 

## How to set up Planview Projectplace integration

### Create a connection

1. From the sidebar, select **Admin** > **Integrations**.

2. In the integrations section, go to the **Planview Projectplace** and select **Manage**.

### Edit an existing connection

You can edit an existing connection’s name and the connection’s shared state that you created from the Projectplace integration view: 

Select the **Edit** icon right next to the connection.  In the dialog that appears, you can make changes to the connection name and enable or disable the **Share connection with all users** checkbox. 

## How to use Planview Projectplace integration 

After your integration is set up, you can connect your new or existing OKRs with a board in Planview Projectplace measure the progress of your OKRs: 

1. When you add or edit an objective or key result, choose to measure progress by **Percent Completed**. 

2. Select **Planview Projectplace** from the list of integrations available. If there are multiple connections listed, choose the connection you want to use.

3. Next, map the OKR to the project, board, assignee, due date, and activity of your choice.

4. Select **Next** to finish and save your OKR. You’ll now see a Planview Projectplace icon next to the OKR‘s progress indicator, which means Viva Goals will automatically measure the progress based on the number of cards moved to the **Done** list (*Completed* state).

5. The OKR syncs automatically every hour. You can also select **Sync Now** to refresh it manually.
