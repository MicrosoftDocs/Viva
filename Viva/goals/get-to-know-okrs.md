**Hi there!**

We're thrilled you're here.

As the saying goes, “Start with Why”, so let's start with why you're probably here:

- Your organization is ready to embark on a new way of setting and reaching goals.
- You heard that OKRs are a proven way to achieve amazing results.

Whether you’re brand new to OKRs, just getting up to speed, or have been using them for years, it’s important to know how they work.

First, let's start with the basics:

## What are OKRs?

OKRs stand for Objectives and Key Results. It's a goal-setting process that allows businesses to solve for the two questions described in the following image:

**Objectives** are simply what you and your team want to accomplish.

The example of objectives added at organizational and teams levels is depicted in the following image:

**Key Results** describe how you'll measure your success in accomplishing these goals.

For best results, teams and individuals should be aligned well in a hierarchy. Key results at one level become objectives of the next level.

**Check-ins** are updates you make to share progress on your OKRs. When you update progress on a key result, it automatically updates the status of the parent objective(s) as appropriate.

The keys to success with OKRs are transparency and alignment. Right from the CEO to managers and colleagues, an employee can view anyone’s OKRs in the system. This undisguised transparency fosters openness and removes conflicts and redundancies with work. OKRs are also aligned vertically and horizontally, allowing employees to see how their work connects with the organization's overall strategic goals.

## Are OKRs a good fit for you?

In most cases, the answer is a resounding **Yes**. OKRs are beneficial for any organization that cares about operational excellence, bringing alignment to their goal-setting process. If you're a small team, the tool helps employees work toward the focused goals with agility. If you're a large organization, it's even more important that all teams align with the common goals of the organization.

For more information on the points to be kept in mind while writing OKRs, see [best pratices](https://help.ally.io/en/articles/2094140-writing-okrs-best-practices-to-keep-in-mind).

## Why have OKRs led to success at so many companies?

Modern business moves at breakneck speed, and all industries are being disrupted through new customer behaviors, aggressive competition, and changing market dynamics.

OKRs provide a framework to allow companies (large and small) to set goals, stay agile, and ensure employees are on board with the latest strategy through five superpowers that are described in the following image and table:

|Superpower Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Focus     |    Because OKRs focus on just 3-5 goals per quarter, it forces organizations to focus on only the work that matters and to make hard choices to eliminate the tasks that *don't* matter.     |
|Alignment     |  Research shows that only 7% of employees understand their company's strategy. OKRs help align company goals from top to bottom so that everyone is rowing in the same direction.       |
|Tracking     |   OKRs are driven by data. Gone are the days when a manager and employee would set an annual performance goal. Today, agile companies use data to inform action and guide strategic decisions.      |
|Transparency     |   A core tenant of OKRs is that anyone can view the goals and progress at any level of the company, from CEO to individual contributor, fostering accountability and collaboration.      |
|Stretch   |    When employees are encouraged to set stretch goals to achieve what mightn't seem possible - and receive support when things fall short - amazing things happen.     |

## How can I ensure OKR success at my company?

You can ensure OKR success in your company by implementing the approaches described in the following table:

|Approach Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|OKR champions     |      Quite often, it's the effort of one key person in an organization (it could be you!) who takes initial ownership of a project and ensures its success. It could be a Chief of Staff, Operations Lead, or the most organized person in a given department. We love our OKR Champions and strive to give them all the support they need.   |
|Leadership support     |    While the energy of the OKR Champion is the key, we’ve found that most successful rollouts also gain support from upper management. Thus, it’s critical that senior leaders educate their organization on the value of OKRs, explain why they're being implemented, reflect on their current culture, and identify key stakeholders .     |
|Use the right tools     |     We believe OKRs are the best way to set goals, and that Viva Goals is the best tool to manage your OKRs. Why? Unlike spreadsheets or manual processes that quickly become unwieldy, Viva Goals scales with your business and provides transparency across your organization.    |
