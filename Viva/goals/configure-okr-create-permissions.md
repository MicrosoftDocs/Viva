# Configure OKR create permissions

## Create organizational level permissions for OKRs and Initiatives

An administrator can set Create permissions to so the following user types, listed in greater detail below, can create OKRs and initiatives at an organization level and at a team level.   

Administrators can set permissions so the following users within an organization can create OKRs and initiative. See the FAQ for specific admin types. 

1.	**Anyone in the organization:** This is a good option for smaller organizations with evolving OKR needs.
1. **Organization admins and organization owners:** Default setting. Restricting OKR creation permissions to only the organization administrators and owners is a safe option as you are able to maintain a structured OKR planning & creation workflow.
2.	**Specific people (along with organization admins & organization owners):** This option is valuable when you want to have a structured OKR planning & creation workflow and assign to specific people to take ownership of it. 

> [!NOTE]
> Organization admins and organization owners will always have access to create organizational OKRs or Initiatives by default. 

### Create permissions for an Organization

1.	Navigate to the organization’s OKRs page.
2. Select the **Settings** tab that you find at the top of the page.  
3. Under **Who can create organization OKRs or Initiatives?**, select the preferred option and select **Save**.    

####  Manage “Create permissions” for organizations  

Admins can view and revoke access of OKR creation permissions at any time by the  following steps: 

1.	Navigate to the organization’s **Settings** tab.  
2. Select **Manage Access** under **Who can create organization OKRs or Initiatives?** Admins can view all the users who have create permissions access.  
3.	Select **X** to remove the name(s) of the user(s) you want to revoke the access for. 
4. Select **Save**.  

> [!NOTE]
> By default, for all newly created organizations,  the default permission setting for Create permissions on organizational OKRs/Initiatives would be ‘Organization admins and organization owners’. The default permission setting can be changed, but organization admins and owners will still maintain access. 

## Create permissions for Teams 

Admins can set Create permissions at the team level to control who can create OKRs and initiatives for the team.  

Similar to organization-level settings,  admins have three options to choose from:  

1.	**Anyone in the organization:** Choose this option if the organization is small and cross-functional, where every user contributes to every team in the organization.
2. **Team admins and Team owners:** Restricting OKR creation permissions to only the team administrators and owners is the default option as admins can maintain a structured OKR planning & creation workflow process.
3.	**Specific people (along with team admins & team owners):** This option helps admins keep a structured OKR planning and creation workflow and assign specific people ownership of the process such as:
    1. All members of this team (This would give access to all the users who are members of this team) 
    1. Custom (This option provides you with the capability to search for users within this organization and grant create permissions access to these users) 


> [!NOTE]
> Permission options may be edited, but team admins and Team owners will always have access to create OKRs or Initiatives irrespective of the option selected. Additionally, organization admins and organization owners will maintain access to create OKRs or initiatives for all teams within the organization. 

### Establish create permission for a Team

1. Navigate to the specific team you want to set the create permissions for.  
1. Select the **Team settings** tab.
1. Under **Who can create OKRs or Initiatives for this team?** select the preferred option.
1. Select **Save**

> [!NOTE]
> When a team is created and the parent team has been defined, the sub-team would default to have the parent team’s create permission setting. This setting can be changed by sub-team managers at any time.  

#### Manage Create Permissions access for teams 

Once admins have created permissions for specific users, they can view and revoke their permissions at any time by the following steps:  

1.	Navigate to the team’s **Team settings** tab.  
2. Select **Manage Access** under **Who can create OKRs or Initiatives for this team?** 
3. View all the users who have create permissions access. 
4. Select **X** against the name(s) of the user(s) to revoke the access and save the setting.    

> [!NOTE]
> By default, for all the newly created organizations the default permission setting for create permissions on team level OKRs or Initiatives would be ‘Team admins and team owners’. This permission setting can be changed later if needed.
