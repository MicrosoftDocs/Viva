# Configure OKR create permissions

## Create permissions for Organizations  

You can set **Create permissions** to provide access for creating OKRs and Projects at an organization level and at a team level.  

1.	**Anyone in the organization:** This is a good option for smaller organizations with evolving OKR needs.
1. **Organization admins and organization owners:** Default setting. Restricting OKR creation permissions to only the organization administrators and owners is a safe option as you’ll be able to maintain a structured OKR planning & creation workflow.
2.	**Specific people (along with organization admins & organization owners):** This option is valuable when you want to have a structured OKR planning & creation workflow and assign to specific people to take ownership of it. 

> [!NOTE]
> Organization/team admins and organization/team owners will have access to create OKRs irrespective of the option. In organization level settings, only org_owners and org_admins would be able to create OKRs for the org by default. 

### Establish create permission for an Organization

1.	Navigate to the organization’s OKRs page.
1. Select the **Settings** tab that you’ll find at the top of the page.  
2.	Under **Who can create organization OKRs or Projects?**, select the appropriate option and select **Save**.  

#### How to manage create permissions for organizations  

When you choose to add specific people to provide create permissions to them, you can view and revoke their permissions at any time. Here’s how: 

1.	Navigate to the organization’s **Settings** tab.  
1. Select **Manage Access** under **Who can create organization OKRs or Projects?** You can view all the users who have **create permissions** access. 
2.	Select the remove button **X** against the name(s) of the user(s) you want to revoke the access for.
3. Select **Save**.  

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot revoke access for the organization admins and organization owners.  

## Create permissions for Teams 

You can set **Create permissions** at the team level to control who can create OKRs and projects for your team.  

Like the organization-level settings, you will have three options to choose from:  

1.	**Anyone in the organization:** Choose this option if your organization is small and works cross-functionally, where every user contributes to every team in the organization.
1. **Organization admins and organization owners:** Default setting. Restricting OKR creation permissions to only the team administrators and owners is a safe option as you’ll be able to maintain a structured OKR planning & creation workflow
2.	**Specific people (along with organization admins & organization owners):** This option helps you keep a structured OKR planning and creation workflow in place and assign specific people the responsibility of owning the process.

> [!NOTE]
> Organization/team admins and organization/team owners will have access to create OKRs irrespective of the option.   

### Establish create permission for a Team

1.	Navigate to the specific team you want to set the create permissions for.   
1. Select the **Team settings** tab.  
2.	Under **Who can create OKRs or Projects for this team?**, select the appropriate option.  
3. Select the **Save** button to save the settings.  

> [!NOTE]
> Sub-teams will automatically follow the Parent team’s ‘Create permissions’ settings. But this setting can be changed by sub-team managers at any time. 

#### How to manage create permissions for teams  

Once you've created permissions for specific users, you can view and revoke their permissions at any time. Here’s how:  

1.	Navigate to the team’s **Team settings** tab.  
1. Select **Manage Access** under **Who can create OKRs or Projects for this team?** You can view all the users who have **create permissions** access.  
2.	Select the remove button **X** against the name(s) of the user(s) you want to revoke the access for and save the setting.  

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot revoke access for the organization/team admins and organization/team owners.
