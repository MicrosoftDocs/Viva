### Frequently asked questions

**Are there other ways to log in to Viva Goals other than using Azure Active Directory credentials?**

Currently, you can only log into Viva Goals by using Azure Active Directory credentials.

**Can anybody in my organization log in?**

Yes, if your organization has purchased or subscribed to Viva Goals, anybody can log in.  

**Do I need to log in using Azure Active Directory every single time I want to access my Viva Goals account?**

If you're logged into any other Microsoft 365 product or service, you'll automatically be directed to Viva Goals without needing to log in.

**How do I log out of my Viva Goals account?**

Select your profile name at the bottom of the left menu in Viva Goals, and then select the **Log out** button.

**What's an *organization* in Viva Goals and when should the user create it?**

An organization in Viva Goals can mean different things to different users. You can create a single organization with all your employees in it if you have a simple hierarchy of organization-level OKRs, followed by department-level OKRs, and team-level OKRs. But in the following cases, it makes sense to create separate organizations: 

- If your business unit (BU) or department wants to track a separate set of organization-level OKRs and align all the teams in that BU or department to those OKRs, you should create a separate organization for your BU or department. 

- If your organization wants to maintain its own information boundary and doesn't want other department members to see its OKRs, you can create a separate organization for yourself or for those departments. 

- If there's a need to administer the rollout and features separately, different departments may want to track OKRs in unique ways. You might want to turn on/off certain customizations or manage different OKR rhythms and cadences (different time periods) or permissions (transparent versus locked). In all these scenarios, it's best to create a new organization. 

**What do the types of organizations (*public* and *restricted*) mean?**

*Public* allows anyone in your company to join your organization without approval.

*Restricted* lets you choose which users get to join your organization. Use this option when you want to keep a tight-knit group of users to maintain information boundaries.
