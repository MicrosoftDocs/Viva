# Log in to Viva Goals and get started with organizations

Any user with a valid Viva Goals license can log in to Viva Goals. Once you've logged in, you can join or create organizations. Organizations usually represent the higher levels of your business hierarchy: either the whole company or specific departments in cases where department autonomy or information compartmentalization is particularly important.

## Log in to Viva Goals

Anyone in the organization can log in to Viva Goals using their Microsoft Entra credentials if you have a valid Viva Goals license assigned by your admin. You don't need to log in if you're already logged in to another Microsoft 365 product or service.

1. Go to the Viva Goals sign-in page at https://goals.microsoft.com/.

1. Use your Microsoft Entra credentials to log in.

1. Once you log in to Viva Goals, you can create or join an organization and begin creating OKRs. Choose one of the following paths to get started with an organization:

    * You can use the company-wide organization, which is a default workspace that all iicensed members in the company have access to.

    * Alternatively, you can [create a new organization](#create-your-own-organization) or [join an existing organization](#join-an-organization).

    * If you're a first-time user invited to join your organization via an invite link, you'll be taken directly to that organization's Viva Goals account. If you're a returning user who's already part of an organization, you'll be taken to the organization that you are a part of.

## Log out of Viva Goals

To log out of Viva Goals, select the profile icon at the top and then select **Sign out**.

## Use the company-wide organization

All members in the tenant who have valid Viva Goals licenses automatically have access to the company-wide organization. A user or team can simply join Viva Goals and create their teams and OKRs under this default organization instead of having to manually create an organization. You can learn more about company-wide organizations [here](company-wide-organization.md).

## Create your own organization

1. If there are no other existing organizations (and the "default organization" is turned off), you will land on the **Create Organization** page. Select **Create Organization**.

1. If you are already inside an organization and want to create a new org, select your organization's name at the top of the left-hand navigation menu. Select the **Create or join organization** option at the bottom; this will take you to the **Create Organization** page.

1. Enter your organization name and a brief description (optional) and select the organization type: **Public** or **Restricted**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A *public* organization is one that anyone in your company can join without needing approval. A *restricted* organization lets you choose which users get to join; restricted organizations are better when you want a tight-knit group of users to maintain information boundaries.

1. Select **Create Organization**.

As the organization owner, you can now add users to your organization by inviting members.

Once you're a member of multiple organizations in Viva Goals, you can use the organization switcher dropdown to switch between different organizations.

## Join an organization

1. Log in to Viva Goals (https://goals.microsoft.com/) using your Microsoft Entra ID.

1. What happens next will depend on your scenario:

    * If you're logging in for the first time and aren't yet a part of any organization, you'll be taken to the **Join organizations** page, where you can select your organization.

    * If you're already a part of an organization, select your organization's name at the top of the left-hand navigation menu, then select **Create or join organization** at the bottom of the resulting organization switcher dropdown. This will take you to the **Join organizations** page.

1. Find the organization you want to join.

    * If your organization is public, you'll see a **Join** button. Select that button to go to your organization's account.

    * If your organization is restricted, you'll see a **Request to join** button. Select that button to send a join request to your organization administrator for approval.
