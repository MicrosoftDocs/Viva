# Enable Microsoft Copilot in Viva Goals

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Viva Goals lets you use generative AI to help set business goals and align teams to your organization’s strategic priorities. It also offers in-app guidance to users for creating, refining, and summarizing goals, as well as for sharing goals updates.

Viva Goals admins can control who has access to Copilot in Viva Goals. You can enable or disable access for specific users, groups, or your entire tenant by using [Viva Feature Access Management (VFAM)](..\feature-access-management.md). VFAM provides a consistent experience across Viva modules to enable or disable access to features, including Microsoft Copilot.  

>[!NOTE]
> - Controlling access to Copilot in Viva Goals by using VFAM is available for all Viva Goals customers starting in August 2024. The previous controls in the Viva Goals admin portal for enabling or disabling access to Copilot will be deprecated starting in August 2024. All existing configurations for enabling or disabling Copilot in Viva Goals are automatically moved to VFAM - you do not need to reconfigure your access settings.
> - A Microsoft 365 Global Administrator can also control access to Copilot in Viva Goals by using VFAM. However, Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

## Licensing requirements

Customers with a *Viva Suite* or *Viva Goals Standalone* license, or a trial version of either, can activate Copilot in the Viva Goals admin center.

## Configuring Copilot access using Viva Feature Access Management

You can enable or disable access to Copilot in Viva Goals for everyone, for specific users, or for specific groups by creating tenant or group level access policies through Viva Feature Access Management.  

There are two ways to create access policies:

- [By using VFAM PowerShell cmdlets](#configure-access-to-copilot-by-using-vfam-powershell-cmdlets)
- [By using the Microsoft 365 admin center](#configure-access-to-copilot-from-the-microsoft-365-admin-center)

### Configure access to Copilot by using VFAM PowerShell cmdlets

For detailed information about controlling access using VFAM cmdlets, including cmdlet syntax, see [Control access to features in Viva](../feature-access-management.md).

For example, to disable access to Copilot in Viva Goals for only your users in Germany, you do the following:

- Create a group access policy in VFAM (using PowerShell cmdlets).
- Assign the Microsoft 365 group that contains all Germany users to the group policy.
- Set the group policy to OFF (disabled).

The following table describes the PowerShell cmdlets, with parameters, that you can use to enable or disable access to Copilot in Viva Goals.

For these examples, the **ModuleId** is *VivaGoals*, and the **featureId** is *CopilotInVivaGoals*.

|Task|Cmdlet|
|-|-|
|View the existing policy.|`Get-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy -ModuleId VivaGoals -FeatureId CopilotInVivaGoals`|
|Update tenant policy to disable access to Copilot in Viva Goals for everyone.|`Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy -ModuleId VivaGoals -FeatureId CopilotInVivaGoals -Name <PolicyName> -IsFeatureEnabled $false -Everyone`|
|Add custom policy to enable Viva Goals co-pilot for specific group or user.|`Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy -ModuleId VivaGoals -FeatureId CopilotInVivaGoals -Name <PolicyName> -IsFeatureEnabled $true -UserIds <user_emails> -GroupIds <group_email>`|
|Add a custom policy to disable access for a specific group or user.|`Add-VivaModuleFeaturePolicy -ModuleId VivaGoals -FeatureId CopilotInVivaGoals -Name <PolicyName> -IsFeatureEnabled $false –UserIds <user_email> –GroupIds <group_email>`|
|Check whether a specific user can access Copilot in Viva Goals.|`Get-VivaModuleFeatureEnablement -ModuleId VivaGoals -Featureid CopilotInVivaGoals  -Identity  <user_email>`|

### Configure access to Copilot from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center  

You can also control access to Copilot in Viva Goals from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.  

To enable or disable access for everyone in your organization, do the following:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Copilot**, and then select **Viva Goals**. Your Org-wide setting shows whether access is enabled for your entire organization.
2. To turn this setting on or off, select **Manage**.
3. Select **On** to enable access for everyone or **Off** to disable access for everyone.
4. Select **Save**.

To enable access for select people or groups, do the following:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Copilot**, and then select **Viva Goals**.
2. Select **Create policy** under **Custom policies for people and groups**.
3. Give your policy a descriptive name. For example, "Disable for users in office X."
4. Select **Off for specific people** if you want to disable access to Copilot in Viva Goals for only people you select. Choose **On for specific people** if you want to enable access only the people you select.
5. Add the people or groups you want the policy to apply to.
6. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can create multiple custom policies to suit your organization's needs.

You can learn more details about enabling Copilot controls from the Microsoft 365 admin center in [Manage access to Copilot in Viva](../copilot/copilot-access-management.md)

## Important things to keep in mind while using VFAM

- The policies created by using VFAM can take up to 24 hours to go into effect.
- The most restrictive policy assigned to a user or group takes precedences over other policies within a feature. For example, for Copilot, if you create an OFF-tenant policy and ON group policy (for users in a specific geographic location, for example), the group policy takes precedence over the tenant policy. As a result only users in the group can access Copilot in Viva Goals.

## What happens Viva Goal Copilot settings configured in the Viva Goals admin portal prior to August 2024?

Now that you can use Viva Feature Access Management to control access to Copilot in Viva Goals, the current control present in the Viva Goals admin portal for users to enable or disable Viva Goals copilot will be deprecated.

All existing configurations set for enabling or disabling the Viva Goals copilot will be automatically moved to VFAM and will work without having to reconfigure it using VFAM. For example, If you have enabled Copilot in Viva Goals for only a specific group of users ('All US employees group') you'll see a corresponding custom access control policy is created on VFAM to allow access only for 'All US employees group'.

Going forward, use VFAM to make changes to access to Copilot in Viva.
