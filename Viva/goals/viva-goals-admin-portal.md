### Managing organizations

As Viva Goals administrators, you can view the list of all organizations from the Organizations Tab. You can click on each record and view the organization information such as the Owner, admins, Join access, numbers of teams and members in the organization etc.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/goals/admin-portal/organization-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the organization tab in the admin portal." lightbox="../media/goals/admin-portal/organization-page.png":::

- As Viva Goals administrators, you can modify the org owner or org admin for any organization from the details pane. For example, to add or remove administrators for the organization click on the admin field in the details pane, search and select the users to be assigned as the org admins. You can also assign multiple admins for the organization. However, only one owner can be assigned for an organization.

- As Viva Goals Administrator, you can also choose to assign yourself as an owner or admin should there be a need to directly administrate the org. This provides Viva Goals administrators with complete control to manage any organization.
