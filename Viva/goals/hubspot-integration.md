# Hubspot integration

## About HubSpot integration
    
Viva Goals HubSpot integration enables you to link objectives and key results (OKRs) to HubSpot sales and marketing metrics for automatic real-time updates on progress. 

Let's use this example: You have an objective to increase the number of marketing qualified leads (MQLs) this quarter. You can use HubSpot integration to save yourself the hassle of going back and forth between HubSpot and Viva Goals to update progress. Viva Goals will sync values for you, saving time while keeping your OKRs current.
    
All users and admins can use the HubSpot integration. Admins also have permissions to manage the integration from the admin dashboard.

## How to connect HubSpot to your Viva Goals account

1. Go to the Viva Goals integrations page at **Admin** > **Integrations**.

5. Viva Goals lets you connect with multiple Hubspot accounts. Select **New connection** to add another instance. You use names to differentiate connections. The names are displayed to members when they link their OKRs to Hubspot.

## How to edit an existing Hubspot connection

Admins can also edit an existing Hubspot connection, including the integrationâ€™s name and shared state  from the Hubspot integration view: 

1. Start in the **Integrations** section in the Admin Dashboard. Select **Hubspot**.  

2. Select the **Edit** icon next to the Hubspot connection. In the dialog box that appears, you can edit the **Connection Name** and select or clear the **Share connection with all users** checkbox.

## How to use Hubspot integration

Now that the integration is enabled, your team can link a Hubspot metric with an OKR:

1. When you add or edit an objective or key result, you can choose to measure progress by **KPI** or **% complete**. Select **HubSpot** from the list of integrations available.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/7/hubspot-integrations-in-the-list-of-datasources-in-viva-goals.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where you select Hubspot as your data source." lightbox="../media/goals/7/hubspot-integrations-in-the-list-of-datasources-in-viva-goals.png":::

2. Create or select a connection. If multiple connections are listed, select the connection that you want to use.

3. Select the product type that you want to integrate with. Currently, Viva Goals integrates with Marketing Hub and Sales Hub.
