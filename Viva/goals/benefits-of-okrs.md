# Benefits of OKRs

## General benefits of OKRs

Massive global enterprise companies have adopted OKRs, and so have 10-20 person companies. OKRs give companies of any size a strategic advantage for many reasons. They can be adopted by individuals in any role.

**OKRs shift focus from output to impact:** By starting with OKRs at the center of business planning, the focus inherently shifts from the outputs your team delivers to the impact they make on the business. In addition to reducing burnout from a lack of clarity around the purpose of that work, this shift in focus helps move the business forward more effectively.

**OKRs create cross-functional cooperation to unify direction and improve collaboration.** When each individual, team, and department goal are aligned to the company’s broader strategy, teams  have a lens through which their work, and the impact it’s intended to have, is prioritized.  

**OKRs help organizations navigate rapid change and reduce risk.** This has been a key benefit of OKRs as companies square off against the pressures of COVID-19. The OKR framework gives a level of visibility into where efforts are focused. It helps leaders proactively manage risk, identifying themes and changes in diverse data sets that might have gone unnoticed without a unifying system. This framework, in turn, helps companies shift focus from activity and output to outcomes, making the right changes at the right time to stay competitive.

**OKRs create clarity that is documented, measurable, and owned.** The OKR framework provides accountability that's tracked and measured in the OKR software or document that a company uses to manage the process. This accountability works two ways: with each individual responsible for their OKRs and company leadership responsible for enabling their pursuit.

**OKRs inspire stretch and foster involvement.** When done well and made the driving force in the company’s strategic rhythm, OKRs can keep every  employee connected to the broader mission and make sure they’re invested in their own contribution to it.  

**OKRs offer clear, contextual communication with continual progress reviews.** The OKR framework doesn't stop when your goals are written. It's designed to create a business rhythm around the most important outcomes that your company is pursuing. It should influence every interaction and drive a review process that pushes for continuous improvement.

## Benefits of OKRs for executives, team owners and managers, and individual contributors

OKRs drive alignment, agility, and impact in your organization. Here are the most impactful benefits of adopting OKRs for executives, team owners, and individual contributors.

**Executives want to establish a high-performing team with a growth mindset that consistently drives stronger business results. OKRs provide these benefits to executives:**

- Full visibility into progress of business initiatives across all levels of the organization

**Team owners, or anyone in a position where they need to make decisions on behalf of a larger group, will have similar benefits to executives. Here are a few of the greatest benefits team owners and managers will experience when adopting OKRs:**
