# Nudge users to check in

In Viva Goals, you can "nudge" a user to check in or update an OKR. Access this option from the progress icon on the left side of the progress bar on the OKR/project list.

The nudge option is visible to all users who aren't the primary check-in owner of the OKR.

The nudge goes out to the user's email.
