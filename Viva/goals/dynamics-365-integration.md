5. Select **next** to complete setup.

Viva Goals allows you to connect with multiple Dynamics 365 accounts. Select **New connection** to continue adding accounts. Each account should have a unique name. Users will be allowed to swap connections when they link their KRs to Dynamics 365.

## How to connect Dynamics 365 metrics to a Key Result (KR)

After setup is complete, users within your organization can link their KRs to any Dynamics 365 metric by connecting to a view or report in Dynamics 365.

1. When you create (or edit) a KR, go to the Progress section and select **Automatically from a data source**.
 
2. From the list of integrations, select Dynamics 365. If you have multiple Dynamics 365 connections, select the connection that your view is associated with before you select the App.
