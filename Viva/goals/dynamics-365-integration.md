# Dynamics 365 integration

Dynamics 365 is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) solution provider that includes many intelligent business applications, such as Sales, Customer Service, Marketing, Project Service, Field Service, Social Engagement, HR, and more.

Integrating Viva Goals with Dynamics 365 allows you to automatically update key results and initiatives with metrics from any Dynamics 365 app, enabling leaders and managers to obtain a holistic view of business operations from within Viva Goals.

1. Select **Next** to complete the setup.

Viva Goals allows you to connect with multiple Dynamics 365 accounts. Select **New Connection** to continue adding accounts. Each account should have a unique name. Users will be allowed to swap connections when they link their key results to Dynamics 365.

## Connect Dynamics 365 metrics to a key result

After setup is complete, users within your organization can link their key results (KRs) to any Dynamics 365 metric by connecting to a view or report in Dynamics 365.

1. Add a new key result or edit an existing key result by selecting that key result's **More options** (**...**) > **Edit**.

1. Under **Progress and Status**, there's a section with the text "Connect to a data source for automatic progress updates" followed by a list of integration icons. Select the **Dynamics 365** icon. If you have multiple Dynamics 365 connections, select the connection that your view is associated with before proceeding to the next step.

1. In the **App** field, select the Dynamics 365 app of your choice to connect its metrics to the KR.
