# OKR Program Analytics

As an organization administrator, or as a Viva Goals user, you're able to see OKR program analytics for your organization and/or teams in your organization.  

To see analytics, navigate to ‘Analytics’ tab on the entity page for organization. The metrics are displayed for the selected time range. You can also see the metric breakdown by teams.

The metrics are divided into three sections:
