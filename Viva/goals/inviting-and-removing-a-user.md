# Invite and remove users in Viva Goals

To onboard your entire organization into Viva Goals, send an invitation to all team members.

Before either of these procedures, you must sign in to Viva Goals using Azure Active Directory and create an account for your organization.  

To log in to Viva Goals, visit: https://goals.microsoft.com/

## Add users via invitation after you create an organization 

1. After you create an organization, select **Continue.**

2. You'll be taken to the **Invite Members** page, where you can enter the names of the users you want to add to your organization.

   Alternatively, you can also add an Azure Active Directory group with all the users you want to invite.

4. If your organization is public, you have the option of sharing a link to join your organization with users.

> [!Note]
> Ensure that all users are provisioned on your organization's Azure Active Directory account.

## Add members via invitation from Viva Goals

To invite users from the Viva Goals menu, select the **Add members** button.

Or, if you're the organization administrator, you can also go to **Settings** and select **Add members** on the Users tab.

Another way to do this is to select **Users** from the menu and then select the **Add members** button.

## Add an AAD group via invitation

To invite a group, you can select the **Add members** button by following any one of the methods mentioned above. Enter the AAD group name in the popup that appears. An invitation will be sent to the group email address. 

Now, all the members in the group will be eligible to log in. The user record will get added to the **All Users** list after they log in for the first time.

> [!Note] 
> Every time a user is added to the AAD group, they will automatically become eligible to log into Viva Goals. However, they will need to log in, at least once, to appear under the **All Users** list.

## Remove a user 

To remove a user from your organization, an admin can deactivate or delete their account: Go to **Admin** -> **Users**. Find the user you want to remove and select **Actions** -> **Deactivate** or **Actions** -> **Delete**. In either case, you'll no longer be billed for that user.

If you have invited users using an AAD group, you can remove the user from the group to deactivate them in Viva Goals as well. 

### Deactivate versus delete a user

A deactivated user will remain visible in Viva Goals but won't be able to sign in. The user will remain assigned as an owner of any OKRs they had. They won't be searchable in **All Users** and will be listed as deactivated in the **Users** section of the admin tools.

To reactivate a user, go to **Action** -> **Make Active**, which will restore their ability to sign in.

Deleting a user is a permanent action and can't be undone. It removes all their activities in the system.

Admins canâ€™t delete users who currently own any objective. To delete those users, reassign their OKRs first, and then delete the user.

**Example scenario of when to deactivate a user**

- When an employee moves from one organization to another within a company

**Example scenario on when to delete a user**

- When the organization administrator receives a request from the user to completely delete all data that can be linked back to them as per GDPR DSR regulations

> [!Note] 
> To find deleted or deactivated users, navigate to the **Users** tab and select the **Deactivate** filter option under the **Status** dropdown.
