# Add the Viva Goals app to Microsoft Teams

This article describes how to install, pin, and interact with Viva Goals directly inside Microsoft Teams. The Viva Goals personal app brings the ability to create objectives and key results (OKRs), check in on them, track progress, and close OKRs within Microsoft Teams.

Preinstalling the app will ensure that your users will be able to see their OKRs directly in Teams without having to install the app from the Teams Store. It's a great way to ensure your users stay in the flow of work, since they'll be able to reference OKRs directly in Teams chats and channels without pausing to install the app.  

We'll show you how to preinstall the app for a specific group of users. If you want to preinstall to all users on the tenant, you can make the same changes in the "Global (Org-wide default)" policy.

> [!Note]
> To do this, you need to be a tenant admin with access to admin.teams.microsoft.com.

**Follow these steps to pre-install Viva Goals:**

1. Log in to https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/ with your user ID and password.
2. Select **Teams apps** and then choose **Setup policies**.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/viva-goals-setup-policies.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the setup policies tab for pre-installing Viva Goals." lightbox="../media/goals/5/viva-goals-setup-policies.png":::

3. Under **Manage Policies**, select **Add** to create a new policy.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/viva-goals-add-policies-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add the appropriate setup policy for pre-installing Viva Goals." lightbox="../media/goals/5/viva-goals-add-policies-button.png":::

4. Enter a name and description for your new policy.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/ms-teams-policy-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to name the appropriate setup policy for pre-installing Viva Goals." lightbox="../media/goals/5/ms-teams-policy-name.png":::

5. To preinstall the Viva Goals app as part of this policy, under **Installed apps**, select **Add Apps** and search for the app by name.
   
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/ms-teams-setup-policies-for-pre-installing-viva-goals.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to search by name to add the Viva Goals app for pre-installation." lightbox="../media/goals/5/ms-teams-setup-policies-for-pre-installing-viva-goals.png":::

6. After you add the app to the **Apps to add** list, select **Add** at the bottom of the dialog to confirm.
7. To make sure users can find the installed app, we recommend you also pin the app and the message extension. Under **Pinned apps**, select **Add app**.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/add-pinned-apps-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where to choose to add an app to pinned apps." lightbox="../media/goals/5/add-pinned-apps-button.png":::

8. Search for and add the Viva Goals app. Select **Save** to confirm the changes to this policy.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/pin-viva-goals-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to search for and pin the Viva Goals app." lightbox="../media/goals/5/pin-viva-goals-app.png":::
   
   > [!Note]
   > The app will be added by default at the bottom of the pinned list. You can use the drag handle on the right side to adjust the position of the app in the list.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/re-order-pinned-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to reorder pinned apps in Viva Goals." lightbox="../media/goals/5/re-order-pinned-apps.png":::
   
9. If you had user pinning turned on, Teams will notify you that user preferences will be applied on top of this policy. Select **Save**.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/user-pin-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows User Pinning enabled." lightbox="../media/goals/5/user-pin-on.png":::

10. You'll now see your new policy under the list in **Manage policies**. Note that the policy hasn't yet been applied to a group of users.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/manage-policies-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the View the policy under Manage policies." lightbox="../media/goals/5/manage-policies-tab.png":::

11. To apply the policy to a group of users, select the **Group Policy Assignment** tab and then select **Add** to create a new assignment.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/add-group-policy-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Adding Group Policy for a group of users." lightbox="../media/goals/5/add-group-policy-button.png":::

    Policies can be applied to any Microsoft Teams team or Microsoft 365 group. Select the group of users you want to apply the policy to.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/policy-groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select the groups to assign the policy." lightbox="../media/goals/5/policy-groups.png":::

13. Next, select the policy from the list and select **Apply** to confirm your selection. 

       :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/policy-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select the policy from the list." lightbox="../media/goals/5/policy-list.png":::

    Now, you'll see the assignment in the list under **Group Policy Assignment**.

       :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/group-policies-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to view the assignment under Group Policy Assignment." lightbox="../media/goals/5/group-policies-list.png":::


    > [!Note]
    > The policy can take some time to kick in. You can check this by going to the Activity Log and seeing if the policy application was complete.

      
      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/activity-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to check the completion of policy application in Activity log." lightbox="../media/goals/5/activity-log.png":::
      
    When you see the timestamp in the **Completed on** column, the policy will work for all the users in the group.

    Now when a user who belongs to this group logs into Teams, the policy will kick in. For example, "Contoso" has "Abigail Jackson" as a member, as we can see in the Microsoft 365 admin.
      
      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/contoso-members-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Abigail Jackson in the list of members." lightbox="../media/goals/5/contoso-members-list.png":::
      
     When Abigail logs into Teams, she can see that both the Viva Goals app and the message extension are preinstalled and pinned on the top left and at the bottom, respectively, in the Teams client.

      :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/5/pinned-viva-goals-with-message-extension.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the pinned Viva Goals app and Viva Goals message extension." lightbox="../media/goals/5/pinned-viva-goals-with-message-extension.png":::
