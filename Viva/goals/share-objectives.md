# Share objectives via email

When you work in Viva Goals, you may want to share an objective or a list of objectives. You might do this to:

- **Provide visibility to stakeholders:** Share a quick update on the status and progress of my team's objectives to keep the everyone up to date.

- **Share a win**: Share an update on a shipped feature, closed funding, or a deal you closed directly to a stakeholder over email.

- **Nudge users**: Request an update from an OKR owner.

## How to share objectives

1. To share objectives from the OKRs page, select the share icon in the upper-right corner of the page and select **Share Summary**.

2. In the **recipients** field, enter email addresses of people you want to share the objectives with. Or, to share the update to all users who are following the OKRs, select the **Include followers ...** checkbox.

3. Select **Add a personal note** if you want to add more context while sharing the summary of objectives.
