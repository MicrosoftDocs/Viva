# Self-service trials  

This article describes how individuals can use self-service trials to experience Viva Goals.  

## Sign up for a trial

Individuals can sign up for self-service trials of Viva Goals on their organization’s existing Microsoft 365 tenants with their business logins. They can try out the full functionality of the product for 60 days before requesting their IT Admins to purchase paid licenses for their business groups.  

To sign up for a self-service trial:

- Visit the Viva Goals launch page at https://goals.microsoft.com/ and click “Start Trial”.

If users or teams run into any issues signing up for trial licenses, then it is recommended that they contact their IT department. There will be no requirement to input payment information when signing up for a trial. IT admins will maintain full control of paid subscriptions. IT Admins cannot sign up for self-service trials and should refer to the guidance for IT Admin trials.  

In order for users or individuals to request self-service trials, IT Admins must select “AllowSelfServicePurchase” to control if users are allowed to make self-service purchases. To see more, visit [AllowSelfServicePurchase for the MSCommerce PowerShell ](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/allowselfservicepurchase-powershell?)

These self-service trials are available worldwide. They are not available for Government & EDU customers.

Individuals can sign up for the trial from the [Goals product page](https://goals.microsoft.com/) or from the Viva Goals app within Microsoft Teams. Self-service trial users can join existing paid or trial organizations in Viva Goals.    

No payment information is required to start the trial. Info about the trial expiration will appear on the Viva Goals webpage.

### Manage trial licenses as a Global or Billing Admin 

The self-service trials for Viva Goals doesn’t compromise IT oversight or control.  If you are an Admin, you can use subscription management capabilities to oversee and manage trial licenses on the Licensing page in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

At the end of the trial period, users who would like to convert to a paid license should work with their IT admin directly to purchase licenses for themselves and/or their business groups. Purchases can be made as part of your Microsoft agreement or visiting the [Microsoft Viva Goals](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-viva/goals) product page. 

If you don't purchase licenses following the trial: 

- Users will no longer be able to access Goals  
- The Organization Owner, Organization Admin or any other regular user can assign the ownership of OKRs, Dashboards and integrations to other licensed users 
- Organizations whose Owners are expired trial users will be deactivated after the trials expire and the orgs will be deleted in 30 days.
