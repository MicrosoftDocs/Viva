# Objective delegation

The Viva Goals Objective Delegation feature lets objective owners delegate another individual to manage OKRs on their behalf.

## What is OKR delegation?

There may be times when you collaborate with other people in your organization and you need to delegate OKRs to another individual to manage on behalf of the OKR owner. The Viva Goals Delegation option provides that functionality.

## Add a delegate to an objective

Users can add a delegate to an objective when they create or edit an objective.

1. Select the more **More Actions** icon, and then select **Edit**.

2. From the edit screen, select the dropdown next to **More Options**.

3. Select **Assign a delegate**.
    
4. In the delegate dialog, select the **Delegate this to** radio button.
    
5. Use the search field to find the team member to whom you'd like to delegate.
    
6. Select from the options to delegate any key results owned by the objective owner and to have the original owner receive notifications.

7. Select **Done**.

## The difference between a delegate and a check-in owner

A *delegate* has permissions to edit all aspects of an OKR except ownership. A *check-in owner* can only check in manually or set up an auto integration. A delegate works on behalf of the OKR owner on a specific objective, while the check-in owner only updates the progress of an objective on behalf of an owner.

If you want another user to check in and update the progress of an OKR, you can use the **check-in responsibility** feature. The check-in owner will be able to check in on the OKR (manual check-in) and set up a data link on the OKR to auto-check in. This user will receive the check-in reminders. In the case of multiple owners, only the user set as **check-in responsible owner** will receive the reminders.

### How to assign responsibility for check-ins

1. Log in to Viva Goals and select the **Add Objective** button to create a new OKR. If you want to modify an existing OKR, you can select it, then select **More** and **Edit**.

2. Identify the objective/key result you want to share with another individual, then select the new owners via the **Owner** option in the **Details** section. You can assign multiple owners for the OKR.

3. After you assign owners, use the **Check-in owner** dropdown in the **Progress** section to select the user who will be responsible for making check-ins. That user will start receiving check-in reminders.

By default, the owner, or the first owner if there are multiple owners, is set as the person responsible for check-in, unless you change this setting.
