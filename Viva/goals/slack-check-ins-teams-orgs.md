# Check-in reminders for your team and organization

Depending upon the OKR check-in cadences, team manager or admin can set all the team members receive check-in reminders for OKRs in Slack and allow them to update on OKRs and initiatives directly from Slack

## Configure Slack workspace to receive OKR updates 

As an admin, you can configure what OKR updates you’d like your team to be notified for. To receive notification from OKR updates, navigate to **Admin** > **Integrations** > **Slack**, and select **Manage**. 

To set up notifications, select **Add Notification**. In the pop-up that appears, choose: 

1. **Send To:** Choose a channel or a person where the notifications will be sent. 
2. **Entities:** Select which Viva Goals team or user you want to get notifications for. 
3. **Events:** Select from an array of options when you’d like to receive notification. For example, you can set up notifications for check-ins or when an OKR is updated.

   All updates to a team's or user's OKRs and initiatives will be delivered to Slack as notifications depending on the admin notification settings for that team or user.

## Nudge users to make check-in 

When an OKR or initiative needs an update and you want to leave a comment specifically as a reminder to OKR owner to make a check-in, you can select the progress icon present on the left of the progress bar, and nudge the person who is responsible for making the check-ins. 

The **Nudge** option is available in the progress popover when you select it. It will be visible to the users who are not the primary check-in owner of the OKR or initiative.

In the popup, you can also see how the check-in owner will be notified. The nudge will go out on Slack if the organization is integrated with Slack.

For Microsoft Viva Goals app for Slack enabled users, the nudge is received by the Viva Goals app in the following format.
