# Teams provisioning overview

Viva Goals allows team owners and team admins to add members to their respective teams using Azure Active Directory Groups. This feature gives the ability to add many members to a team quickly and easily.

Admins and owners can add up to five groups to a team as members. For example, admins and owners can add mail enabled security groups, mail enabled nested groups, distribution lists and dynamic Azure Active Directory groups to teams as members. Currently, Microsoft 365 Groups aren't supported for this feature.   For more information, see the [FAQ section](/viva/goals/teams-provisioning#faqs-frequently-asked-questions).
