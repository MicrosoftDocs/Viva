# Writing recommendations

Looking to improve your healthy OKR program? Here are recommendations you can perform within Viva Goals: 

1. **Set company-wide and top-level team OKRs** 
    1. Make sure OKRs are set by senior leadership to promote alignment and transparency across your organization.  

1. **All Objectives should have at least one KR** 
    1. For each Objective within Viva Goals, there should be at least one Key Result, and ideally 3-5. In other words, there shouldn't be any "orphaned" Objectives — if a goal is important enough, it should have 3-5 measurable KRs associated with it; if you can’t come up with at least 3, the Objective should be removed or combined with another goal.
    
1. **Write quality OKRs**
    1. Review your OKRs to make sure they're aspirational and measurable. If you’re just starting out, follow the formulas included in this resource, or draw from our sample OKR library during the creation process.
