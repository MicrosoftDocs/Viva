# How to write annual, organizational goals using the “5 Ps”

When implementing a goal-setting program, one of the most common approaches is to begin with the senior leadership team. Their first mission is to map out annual, organizational objectives, dictating the most important three to five goals that the company wants to achieve in the coming year.  

> [!NOTE]
> Throughout this article, the term “objectives” represents top-level goals.

Senior leaders need to set aside enough time to give these goals proper consideration, as they map the direction of the organization, to which every team member will align. Companies often set aside a full day or more, including hosting the planning session outside the traditional office environment, at a team offsite. If the team is working remotely, give executives plenty of notice to block off several hours for an interruption-free online meeting.

> [!TIP]
> Mindset exercise: Imagine hosting a lavish New Year’s Eve party for all of your employees, and all the departments are celebrating the massive success you’ve had this year. The clock is winding down, and in the 5 minutes you have before the end of the year, you’re going to address the crowd and summarize the goals you’ve achieved.  What is the story you want to tell?
>
>If you could look back at the end of the year and highlight three to five major things, what would make the most dramatic impact on your business? These are your annual, organizational objectives.

Recommended best practices for objectives:

- They should be actionable.
- They should be aspirational.
- They should be meaningful.
- They should be easy to remember.

Ideally, they should also cover not just "the what," but also "the why". Try using the following formula: **verb + What you’re going to do + “so that” or “in order to”**

If this is your first time implementing goals, or if you’re looking for some structure to build best practices, there are five broad categories to consider.

We call these "the 5 Ps:"

- Profit
- Product or Service
- People
- Promotion
- Progress

## Profit (How you make money)

This first Objective is a financial one. This category can be a good place to start, since it often fuels the growth of other areas of the company.

Depending on your organization, this objective could be attributed to the sales team, the finance team, or simply revenue generated from your product or service if you don’t have salespeople.

Let’s look at some bad examples first:

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **Objective**: Make more money.
> - **Objective**: Make $10 million dollars.

While the intention is right here, the phrase “Make more money” is too vague. “Make $10 million dollars” also lacks the context necessary to be a great goal.

Better example:  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Objective**: Create a profitable and sustainable company in order to increase annual revenue.

This phrasing is better and more meaningful for employees because it includes the “why” by including measures of profitability and sustainability.

## Product or Service (What you sell or do)

The second Objective centers around your product or service. These are the goals you have for what you sell, whether that’s accounting software or exercise clothing, or the service you provide, such tax preparation or fitness classes.

Bad examples might include:

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **Objective**: Ship a new product.
> - **Objective**: Get more high-end clients.

Once again, these options are too vague and not aspirational, so we’ll edit them.

Better example:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Objective**: Deliver a "must have" product in order to delight customers and grow our user base.

This phrasing is better because it's aspirational and frames the product as something that people can’t do without, and highlights the outcome you want to achieve - happy customers and more users.

## People (Who your team is)

The third objective focuses on your people. Your internal team are one of your most valuable, and often most expensive, assets, so use this category to set goals around hiring, employee engagement, company culture, or business operations.  

Sometimes writing these goals can be a challenge, because they often have less tangible metrics versus those in engineering or sales groups.

A bad example might be:

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **Objective**: Expand team size.

This example falls into the same trap as “Make more money.” Simply “getting bigger” for the sake of getting bigger isn't an inspiring goal and lacks clarity.

Better example:  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Objective**: Build a world-class company culture in order to attract and retain the best employees.

This phrasing is better because it communicates three important things in one sentence:

1. Building a great culture
1. Attracting new employees
1. Retaining current employees

## Promotion (How you get out the word)

The fourth objective focuses on promotion. What good is building a great company if nobody knows about it? This category can be used for buckets such as marketing, advertising, branding, content, public relations, and other ways that you get out the word about what you do.

A bad example might be:

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **Objective**: Gain 1 million followers on social media

Having a million followers on the latest popular platform may increase your organization's visibility, but lacks the context and reasoning to be a successful goal.  

Better example:  

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Objective**: Elevate our brand presence in order to attract new prospects and create a fiercely loyal customer following.

This example focuses on the larger goal of elevating your brand presence and focuses on deep customer loyalty.

## Progress (What will dramatically move the business forward?)

The fifth and final Objective is Progress. What you want to consider is a goal that will dramatically move your business forward.

Some bad examples might be something like:

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - **Objective**: Increase sales by 5%.
> - **Objective**: Reduce customer service response time by 3 hours.
> - **Objective**: Update all marketing materials to new brand colors.

These may be important initiatives, but they're unlikely to dramatically affect your organization.

Example case study: Automobile manufacturer Contoso Cars was founded in 1950 and became known for their sports cars. In the 1990s the company introduced their first SUV, and introduced a larger model in the 2000s.  

The decision to launch that vehicle wasn’t improving business as usual or refreshing their logo. It was aspirational and ambitious and dramatically changed the trajectory of the company.

Although one of th benefits of setting great goals is increasing focus on your organization's core objectives. However, you might decide that changing market or operating conditions require a dramatic change. 

Let’s see a few more business examples, and paint the before and after picture for each:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Goals**: Expand into the Latin American market in order to capture 15% market share from competitors. </br>
> **Desired result**: A stagnant company with lagging US sales boldly enters a brand new market and disrupts their competition.
>
> **Goal**: Migrate our entire financial system to a modern, cloud-based platform to enable real-time data reporting. </br>
> **Desired result**: A manufacturing company with outdated technology updates their IT systems to create efficiencies that will scale output and lead to faster decision-making.
>
> **Goal**: Launch financial planning services in order to diversify away from the core business of tax preparation. </br>
> **Desired result**: A medium-sized tax preparation company reliant on seasonal revenue diversifies to offer high-margin financial planning services that provide recurring revenue.

## Summary

Writing annual, Organization-level Objectives is a crucial part of the goal setting process. Objectives should be actionable, aspirational, and meaningful, and should outline the story you wish to describe your accomplishments for the year.

As a guide, consider the following five areas to focus your Objectives:

- Profit
- Product or Service
- People
- Promotion
- Progress
