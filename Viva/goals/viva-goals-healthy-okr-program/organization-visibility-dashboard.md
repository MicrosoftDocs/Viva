# Organizational Visibility Dashboard and ROB 

Organizations can incorporate goals into their rhythm of business (ROB) by using dashboards across key meetings and activities in order to build a healthy goal program. 

**Value Driver:** Drive visibility of organizational goals 

**Objective of this meeting:** The purpose of this activity is to drive visibility of organizational goals by broadly sharing goals to every member of the team so that they understand the company direction.  

If you’ve ever had team members raise their hands and ask, “What is the big picture vision of the company?” or “Can we see a roadmap for the rest of the year?” or “What is the status of our top three initiatives?” then this is the place to answer those questions.  

While communicating a common vision is always important, this is often used in the modeling phase of a rollout to encourage opt-in experimentation with Viva Goals, and help build a community of champions and enthusiasts. 

**Who is involved**

- **Meeting owner:** CEO or Organizational lead
- **Audience:** Entire organization

**Meeting categories**

These are communication types that you might already have in your existing rhythm of business. Remember, we’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, but rather, incorporate goals into your existing workflow. 

- All hands meeting 
- Organizational town hall 
- All company newsletter 

**How goals help**

- Goals provide the context to report out to your broader organization about successes, learnings, and next steps 
- Surface constraints such as budget, bandwidth, and priorities to allow for adjustments 
- Engage employees across the entire company, from senior executives and department leaders to team members that might not own goals 
- Ensure ongoing, consistent accountability toward goals 

**Key milestone**

- Easy to follow, high-level dashboard report for senior leadership to communicate what we accomplished as an organization, what we can celebrate together, what were the key lessons learned, and what are we doing next. 
- Goals can also be embedded in an all-company newsletter 

## Organizational Visibility Dashboard

The dashboard for an “All Hands” or “Town Hall” meeting might have the following elements, or widgets, within Viva Goals. 

|Widget type   |Widget name   |Use  |Benefit  |
| :--------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| Text block   | Agenda   | Communicate the agenda for the meeting.    | Helps set the context for everyone for the meeting.   |
| Text block  | Updates from last time period  | Used to communicate wins, key learnings, current blockers, and upcoming steps.   | Enables all team members to get a holistic snapshot of recent progress.   |
| OKR list   | View current objectives    | List top-level OKRs to demonstrate progress against goals.   | Enables all team members to have transparency into how the organization is tracking against their metrics.    |

## How to run an Organizational Visibility meeting

Each organization has their own unique style for running all hands meetings or town halls depending on their culture and the personality of its leader.  

- But here's a general flow that most companies can follow: 
- Meeting kickoff / small talk as team members sign on to the video chat or arrive to the meeting location (CEO or Chief of Staff) 
- Meeting agenda shared (CEO or Chief of Staff) 
- Recognition of key individuals and/or celebration of team accomplishments (CEO or Chief of Staff) 
- High level review of organizational goals (CEO) 
- High level review of department level goals (CEO or Department leaders) 
- Core meeting activities such as: 
    -  Major news and announcements 
    - New product or service information or demonstration 
    - Spotlight on a particular group, team, product, or goal 
    - Guest speaker or interview with a customer 
- Question and answer or “ask me anything” session 
- Closing remarks and action items
