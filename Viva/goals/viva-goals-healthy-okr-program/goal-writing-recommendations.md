# Goal writing recommendations

Looking to get started with a goal-setting program or take your goals from good to great? Here are some recommendations:

**1. Start with clear and simple goals**

- Communicate to your team the benefits of proper goal setting, and what you hope to achieve.

- If you have a goal-setting process and meeting rhythm already in place, build upon that as opposed to starting something new.

- Keep things simple to start, beginning with senior leadership or just a few teams, and limiting scope to 3-5 goals at most.

**2. Choose a goal-setting framework and adhere to best practices**

- Whether you prefer OKRs, SMART goals, or KPIs, a [goal-setting framework](goal-setting-frameworks.md) will help provide a structure to guide the process of setting and achieving goals.

- Don’t reinvent the wheel – view our list of [pitfalls and best practices](goal-setting-pitfalls.md) to learn from the experience of others.

**3. Great goal writing is an iterative process**

- Don’t get discouraged if your first round of goals could use some improvement.

- Ask good questions and refine your goals during the writing process, then learn and iterate from what worked and what didn’t with each subsequent time period.
