# Power BI Integration

Key Results and initiatives that use metrics to track completion in Viva Goals can directly connect to data from reports in Power BI using our simple point and click interface. Viva Goals will sync the data at regular intervals, ensuring your Key Results and initiative always stay up to date with the latest progress. 

## How to connect your Key Result to data from Power BI 

1. Add a new Key Result or open an existing Key Result for Edit.

2. Under the Progress section, select **Automatically from a data source** and then from the list of Integrations, select **Power BI.**

    > [!NOTE]
    > If Power BI is disabled, your Viva Goals administrator will need to enable it for your organization. See **How to enable Power BI Integration** below.

3. The first time, you will be presented with a screen to sign in to Power BI. Sign in with your Viva Goals credentials. A screen will appear to save a new connection. Name the connection and select **Next.** 

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Only you will have access to this connection, it will not be shared with anyone else. 

4. Once logged in to Power BI, you can select the report you want to link data from and click **Next.**
