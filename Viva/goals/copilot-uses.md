# Use Copilot in Viva Goals to create, summarize, and understand goals

Microsoft Copilot in Viva Goals gives you a number of ways to generate and summarize goals; it also provides a conversational interface that can answer questions about goals methodology.

## Generate goals using a strategy document

Copilot in Viva Goals can read through strategy or planning documents and propose appropriate goals or OKRs.  

Viva Goals does not store your documents or conversational prompts for any purpose. You can find more information about how Microsoft uses Copilot data in Viva Goals [here](..\viva-privacy.md).

## Generate key results for existing goals

## Generate goals using the conversational Copilot interface

When you're in the planning stage, you can chat with Copilot in Viva Goals to get ideas for new goals. Copilot will suggest goals based on your organization's existing goals data, user profiles shared with Viva Goals, and any information you provide in conversation with Copilot.

> [!TIP]
> When you're giving Copilot instructions to help you generate goals, it helps to be as descriptive as possible. Consider mentioning your business industry, department, and three to five topics or themes you think your team or organization should focus on. For example, you might say this:
>
> *I work for a retail company in the marketing department. This year, we want to become the market leader, expand to new geographic regions, and increase our product offerings.*

## Summarize goals

You can use Copilot in Viva Goals to access summaries of goals, including team goals and collections of OKRs. Team managers and department leaders can easily generate summaries of their teams' progress. Copilot will analyze check-in data, status updates, and progress details associated with child items to prepare a quick summary. Users can share these summaries as updates, use them to prepare for review meetings, or let them serve as check-ins for their objectives.

## Understand goals

Copilot in Viva Goals can answer questions about goals methodology, such as what exactly OKRs are, the best ways to run OKR rhythms, and how to plan around OKRs.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot in Viva Goals is under constant development. The content generated by Copilot will not always be reliable: for example, Copilot is great at generating OKRs and answering questions related to OKRs, but it's not capable of understanding what's true or factual. Use your own judgment and verify AI-generated content when using Copilot.
