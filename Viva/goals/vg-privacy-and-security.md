## Viva Goals Security and Compliance 

The Viva Goals service follows the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), strict security practices that support security assurance and compliance requirements. The SDL helps developers build more secure software by reducing the number and severity of vulnerabilities in software, while reducing development costs. Learn more at [Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle Practices](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl/practices). 

### Viva Goals Architecture 

The Viva Goals architecture is a multi-tier application with front ends, a Web Application layer, Background job processing, Integration APIs, and Storage systems to name a few. Viva Goals is implemented as a multi-tenant architecture deployed in the M365 public cloud with Security, Scalability, Updatability, Operability, Compliance, Performance, Privacy, and Availability in mind.  

Viva Goals ensures high availability of dependent services through a fault-tolerant architecture. In addition, monitoring and Incident Response processes are set up to operate at a high availability. We maintain separate standby regions for Disaster Recovery to withstand regional failure. 

Viva Goals is constantly modernizing the technical architecture to innovate and meet the growing needs of customers. However, we also strive to ensure that none of these changes impact new or existing customers. Changes will not require our customers to upgrade software/hardware.

Users can use the Web Client or Teams app to connect to and use Viva Goals. HTTPS requests go through Azure Front Door, which acts as the single point of entry for all web requests to the Viva Goals application. Azure Front Door is used for its Web Application Firewall (WAF) as well as Content Delivery Network (CDN) capabilities for Viva Goals. The CDN is used to deliver static assets such as images, icons, JavaScript files, style sheets, etc. The requests received by Azure Front Door are routed to the API Management service and a load balancer. This service acts as the proxy between Azure Front Door and the Web Application layer, which resides within a private virtual network. Viva Goals also uses session-based rate limiting configured on the API management service to protect the service. The secrets required during the application lifecycle are stored in our service’s Azure Key Vault and are retrieved at runtime. Viva Goal’s primary data store is Azure PostgreSQL, but other compliant Azure data stores are also leveraged where necessary (see table below): 


|Storage Service   |Usage  |
|---------|---------|
|Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL      |The primary relational data store for user content like Objectives, Key Results, Projects, and others. Powered by the Citus open-source extension to PostgreSQL. Sharding solution layered on PostgreSQL for scale out.          |
|Azure Cosmos DB      |Cached, serialized view of content for fast reads.          |
|Azure Cognitive Search      |Search engine to enable user search of OKR content.          |
|Azure Synapse and Data Lake      |Used to power Insights dashboard within Viva Goals.          |
|Azure Cache for Redis      |Used to store asynchronous job information.          |
|Azure Blob Storage      |Blob storage for user’s profile pictures, file exports such as OKR reports, and others.           |

#### Viva Goals Data Handling

1. **Is Data at rest encrypted?**
    1. Yes. The Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL service uses the FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module for storage encryption of data at-rest. Data, including backups, are encrypted on disk, including the temporary files created while running queries. The service uses the AES 256-bit cipher included in Azure storage encryption, and the keys are system-managed. Storage encryption is always on and cannot be disabled. Data persisted in other data stores is encrypted by default with AES 256-bit key encryption using Microsoft managed keys. In addition, we use other data stores provided by Azure and secured with Microsoft and O365 practices. All the data is stored within a private virtual network and does not leave Microsoft's trust boundary. 

2. **Is Data in transit encrypted?**
    1. Yes. Viva Goals requires all incoming HTTP traffic to be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or above. Any requests attempting to use the service with TLS 1.1 or lower will be rejected. 

3. **Who has access to the data?**
    1. Only employees with a legitimate business need can access customer data, and all access is on an approval‐only basis. All access is logged and regularly audited. 

4. **Do you have a Data Protection Officer?**
    1. Yes. DPO can be reached via https://www.microsoft.com/concern/privacy.  

5. **Can we perform an on‐site visit or audit of your facilities?**
    1. Viva Goals doesn't permit customers to perform on‐site audits as they pose a risk to the security of the service. We will answer any security questions openly and transparently. 

6. **Do you conduct third‐party penetration testing?**
    1. Penetration tests of the Viva Goals infrastructure are conducted yearly as part of Office 365 practices.

7. **Do you comply with the data protection act in my country?**
    1. As the data controller, it is your responsibility to ensure you comply with the data protection regulation that applies to you. However, Viva Goals has controls in place to help you meet your regulatory obligations. You must independently assess your regulatory obligations and ensure your use and configuration of Viva Goals meets them. 

8. **How is data separated from other tenants?**
    1. Viva Goals implements a multi-tenant model. As such, customers' data is logically separated with strict controls to ensure separation of tenant data. The web application servers of Viva Goals are physically and logically separated from servers that store customer data. 

9. **Does Viva Goals sell our data?**
    1. No. Viva Goals does not mine or sell any customer data. All data belongs to the customer. 

10. **Can I export all my data?**
    1. In Viva Goals, Organization Admins can designate Admins, Team Admins, or a set of specific users who are allowed to export OKR related data, along with their metadata.

11. **What are Viva Goals’ business continuity features / data recovery?**
    1. Your data is backed up multiple times a day, stored in Azure storage, and protected with strong encryption at rest. Additionally, data is continually replicated in Azure regions separate to the primary region to withstand region outages. Viva Goals runs periodic disaster recovery drills to test recoverability of data and dependent services upon failure. 

12. **How is data managed through Viva Goals’ integrations?**
    1. There is over forty-five different 1P and 3P integrations, most of which focus on pulling data from external services into Viva Goals. Data integrations (that automatically update OKRs when your work gets done) pull data from external systems into Viva Goals (one-way sync). Integration such as Slack/Teams uses a bi-directional sync and enable Viva Goals to be in the flow of work of the user (two-way sync). <br></br> The Integration authentication mechanism is oAuth2-based when available; otherwise, a user’s API token or username/password is utilized to connect to other services. Credentials provided, such as username/password or OAuth tokens, are encrypted and stored in the database. The keys to encrypt are unique to an org and are in turn encrypted and stored in the database using Key Encryption Key (KEK) that resides in Azure managed HSM Key vault. 

13. **What kind of personal data do you process?**
    1. Viva Goals abides by the Microsoft Trust policies and procedures to minimize the use of personal data for any processing activity. Viva Goals only consumes personal data from Azure Active Directory. Additionally, customer content related to 3P integrations will be captured and processed (all such data is encrypted and stored in our database). The following are examples of personal information required by Viva Goals for application-specific purposes: Name, Addresses, Job Title, Department, City Country, User Type, Preferred Language, Profile Photo, Manager. In addition to this, some third-party integrations may push fields (e.g., Employee cost center, Department/Team/Organization) with the consent of customers. 

14. **Who has access to personal data?**
    1. Microsoft personnel have no standing access to customer data. Access to such data is safeguarded by controls including approval workflows only when required to support the customer. IT admin can reach out to Microsoft support through Admin centers to raise queries for their personal data. Please refer to “how to contact us” section in Privacy statement [here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement#mainnoticetoendusersmodule). 

15. **How long will personal data be retained before being erased?**
