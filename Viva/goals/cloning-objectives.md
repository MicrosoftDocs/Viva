# Clone objectives 

Cloning objectives helps your OKR process run more efficiently. 

## When to clone objectives 

There are two key situations when cloning is useful: 

### When you set up new objectives for the current time period

If you're collaborating on writing OKRs with cross-functional teams, you may find that OKRs move from team to team, or that you want to use a slightly modified version of another team's OKR on your team to ensure you're rowing in the same direction. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the clone function in Viva Goals to make a duplicate copy of an objective, and then edit it easily. 

Cloning makes it simple to make a copy but still allows customization.

### When you roll over unfinished objectives to a new time period

If you're scoring and closing objectives in Q2 in preparation for Q3, you may have unfinished objectives that you want to continue working on. In this case, you want to roll your OKRs over to Q3. 

Cloning is a more effective way to do this than simply editing the time period of the unfinished objective. By making a clone, you can "reset" the objective's progress for the next time period, while saving your progress in the current time period. In this way, you can show your progress in Q2 and continue progress in Q3. 

You can edit the cloned objective to reflect the leftover portion of the goal in Q3 but make sure the work youâ€™ve already accomplished is still attributable to Q2.

## How to clone a single objective

1. Hover over the objective and select **Clone** from the dropdown on the far right. You can also do this from the Objective page: Select **Actions** -> **Clone**.

2. Choose options from the dialogue box:

    - By default, Viva Goals defaults to the current time period, which is useful if you're duplicating new objectives. If you're carrying over unfinished objectives into the future, choose the appropriate time period from the dropdown menu.
    
    - Choose to keep the original objective owner, or assign a new one.
    
    - Choose to clone:
       - **Only the objective** - Won't clone any children.
       - **Objective and its immediate children** - Won't clone any children that the objective's immediate children might have.
       - **Objective and all its children** - Will clone all children even if an objective's immediate children have children.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Select **Keep original objective owner** if you want to retain the original owners for the objectives, key results, and initiatives in the hierarchy. If you want to change the OKR owner, you can assign it to yourself or anyone on your team. All the OKRs and initiatives in the hierarchy will be assigned to the new owner.

3. If necessary, edit the newly cloned objective. For example, you might change key results or KPIs to reflect the remaining work in the new time period.

## How to clone multiple objectives

1. Select the checkboxes to the left of the objectives that you want to copy. Only open objectives can be cloned in bulk. Objectives that have been closed must be cloned individually.

2. Select the **Clone** button in the blue bar that appears above the list of objectives.

3. Choose the options from the dialogue box.

>[!NOTE]
>The cloning operation happens asynchronously without blocking you from performing other actions in Viva Goals. The time to complete cloning depends on the number of OKRs you're cloning. If you try to clone multiple times during the process, you'll end up with multiple clones.
