# OKR contributions
  
The Viva Goals OKR contribution feature gives OKR owners and creators flexibility when they specify how much weight each objective, key result, and initiative has in moving toward a goal. This power helps in tracking progress and prioritizing OKRs and initiatives. 
  
Users can define and control contribution at the parent level. All the contributions add up to a total of 100 percent, and objective owners and creators can mark a child’s contribution as fixed. This option is available only for OKRs that have progress mode to **Updated via roll-up from key results**. 

**Any Viva Goals user who has edit permissions for an OKR (including check-in owners) can edit the contributions of children OKRs.**

## How to manage OKR contributions
  
1. To set or edit your OKRs' contribution select **Manage contributions** from the **More actions** dropdown. 

   > [!NOTE] 
   > You can also open the "Manage contributions" dialog from the Objective quick view and from the Detail view.

2. Use the **Manage contributions** dialog box to add or edit the contributions of the children OKRs and initiatives.

   You can enable or disable the **Newly aligned items should start contributing by default** option, which configures newly created child OKRs and or initiatives to contribute to the parent. This will readjust the contributions you assigned to each child OKR or initiative.  
  
   > [!Note]
   > By default, **New children should start contributing by default** is enabled. 

3. After you edit contributions, select **Save**.  

## Key considerations for OKR contributions

- OKR contribution is available only for OKRs that have progress mode set to **Updated via roll-up from key results**.

- All contributions will add up to a total of 100 percent. The default contribution is automatically assigned to children equally. For example, if an objective has three key results (children), the default contribution assigned to each child is 33.33 percent. 

3. As soon as a child’s contribution is edited, the contribution is considered "fixed." If a new child is added or an existing child is removed, the contributions marked as fixed won't be adjusted. For example, if an objective has three key results (children) and the contribution of the first key result is edited to be 50 percent, the contributions of the second and third key result will be automatically adjusted to 25 percent each. In the future, if a fourth key result is added, only the contribution of the second and third key result will be adjusted.

To reset all the custom contributions to the defaults, select the **Reset to default** option.
