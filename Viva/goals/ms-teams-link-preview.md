# Link previews in Microsoft Teams and Outlook

When you paste a link from Viva Goals into the Microsoft Teams message box, you'll see a link preview with relevant details about the item. This provides users with context about the goals they're working toward. By selecting **View Details** on the link, users can update these goals without leaving the conversation.

Link previews are provided for the following items in Viva Goals:

- OKR and initiative lists
- OKRs and initiatives
- Check-ins
- Updates

## How link previews work

### OKRs and initiative lists

1. Navigate to the team or user in Viva Goals whose OKRs or initiatives you want to share.
    - If you're using Viva Goals in a web browser, copy the URL from the browser address bar.
    - If you are in Teams, select **Share** > **Copy link**.
1. Head to your chat or channel of choice and paste the URL.
1. The link will unfurl into a link preview. Note that the OKRs/initiatives shown will correspond to the time period you were viewing when you copied the link.

### OKRs and initiatives

To share an OKR or initiative, navigate to the specific OKR or initiative you want to share and select **Share** > **Copy Link**.

### Check-ins

You can share a specific check-in, perhaps to ask questions about the progress made. This option is available in the Share menu for individual check-ins. Currently, only manual check-ins support sharing. Rollups and check-ins from integrations don't have a Share option.

### Updates

If your team is using the [Share an update](goals-broadcast.md) feature to send updates about overall progress, you can reshare these updates to Teams by going to the Updates tab. There, you can find the Share options for each individual update.

## Viewing details from a link preview

When you select **View Details** within the preview, you're taken to a *stage view*. A stage view is a focused experience within the chat or channel. From the stage view, you can work on the item through Viva Goals, whether that item is a list, check-in, update, or something else. This lets you update progress or edit the item directly.

If you want to see more details, you have two options:

- **Open in App**, which will open the Viva Goals app in Teams.
- **Open in Web**, which will open the web version of Viva Goals.

## Link previews and privacy

If an OKR is marked as private, Viva Goals won't show a link preview. Similarly, if private OKRs are part of a list that is being previewed, those OKRs won't be shown or counted in the list of items.  

## Support for Outlook

The Viva Goals app for Microsoft Teams also works in Outlook and Microsoft 365. When a link is pasted in a message in Outlook, link previews work just as they do in Microsoft Teams, provided the app is installed in Outlook. For more information, see [Teams apps that work on Outlook and Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365).
