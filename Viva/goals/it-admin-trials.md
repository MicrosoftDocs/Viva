# IT admin-led trials

This article describes how to set up and run an IT Admin-led trial pilot program to deploy Viva Goals to your organization.  

## Sign up for a trial

Trials are publicly available from one of the following sources. These IT Admin trials offer 50 users access to Viva Goals for 60 days. 

To sign up for a trial, please visit either: 

- The [Microsoft Viva Goals homepage ](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-viva/topics?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
- The [Microsoft 365 admin center ](https://admin.microsoft.com/)
    - Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/). 
    - Go to **Billing** > **Purchase Services**. 
    - Scroll down to the **Add-ons** section. 
    - On the Microsoft Viva Goals tile, select **Details**. 
    - Select **Get free trial**. 
    - Follow the remaining wizard steps to confirm the trial. 

These admin-led trials are available worldwide. They aren't available for Government customers.  

The expiration date appears in the trial subscription details page within the Microsoft 365 admin center. Upon expiration of the trial, the user won't be able to access their content on Viva Goals and will have to reach out to their IT Admin to purchase a paid license for themselves and their business groups.

## Activate a trial

When you initiate a trial, you need to: 

- Assign licenses to the relevant users. 
- Inform the trial users to access Viva Goals by visiting https://goals.microsoft.com from their browser or by adding and opening the Viva Goals app on Microsoft Teams

## During a Trial

The trial period should be used to evaluate the following components of Viva Goals: 

- The Objective and Key Results capabilities used to set goals, align teams and track progress  
- The ability of Viva Goals to work within the flow of work, including integrations into [Microsoft Teams](ms-teams-integration.md) and [other Microsoft or partner solution integrations](integrations-overview.md)

For Best practices and guidance on running a successful trial, check out our [Trial Checklist](trials-checklist.md).

## After a Trial

Based on the outcome of the trial, you can decide whether to proceed to purchase licenses of Viva Goals. 

To ensure continuity of service, you must purchase the required number of licenses and assign those licenses to users. Trial users who don't have a full license at the end of the trial period won't be able to access any Viva Goals experiences. 

If you don't purchase licenses following the trial: 

- Users will no longer be able to access Goals  
- The Organization Owner, Organization Admin or any other regular user can assign the ownership of OKRs, Dashboards and integrations to other licensed users 
- Orgs whose Org Owners are trial users will be deactivated after the trials expire and the orgs are deleted in 30 days.
