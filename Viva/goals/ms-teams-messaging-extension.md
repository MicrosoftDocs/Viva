# Microsoft Teams Extension

## How to switch organizations

The message extension can search for OKRs and Initiatives in any organization you are part of. (see organizations). To switch your active organization, click on ‘More Options’ in the top right corner of the message extension, and choose ‘Switch organization’.

## Share OKR updates in Microsoft Teams chats

You can surface specific OKRs and initiatives within your Teams chats to add more context to your conversations. You can discuss progress, proactively identify and resolve blockers, and use Viva Goals to focus on the work that needs your attention. With the Microsoft Teams messaging extension, you can also make updates to your OKRs without leaving your chat.

> [!NOTE]
> To proceed with these steps, you need a Viva Goals account.

Follow these steps to insert an OKR/initiative in your textbox:

1. Log in to the Teams app.
2. Open the chat where you want to surface your OKR progress.
3. Select the ellipse **...** button below the text box.

4. In the search box, type **Viva Goals**. The messaging extension for your organization's Viva Goals account will appear.

6. Enter the title of the OKR/initiative you're looking for. As you type, suggestions will appear, and you can pick one. You'll then see a card for that OKR/initiative in the text box.
