## Share OKR updates in Microsoft Teams chats

You can surface specific OKRs and initiatives within your Teams chats to add more context to your conversations. You can discuss progress, proactively identify and resolve blockers, and use Viva Goals to focus on the work that needs your attention. With the Microsoft Teams messaging extension, you can also make updates to your OKRs without leaving your chat.

> [!NOTE]
> To proceed with these steps, you you need a Viva Goals account.

Follow these steps to insert an OKR/initiative in your textbox:

1. Log in to the Teams app.
2. Open the chat where you want to surface your OKR progress.
3. Select the ellipse **...** button below the text box.
