# Google Sheets integration

## About Google Sheets integration

Viva Goals Google Sheets integration allows you to link KRs to Google Sheet cells for real-time updates of your progress. 
  
Say, for example, you have a Google Sheet used to track survey responses. By implementing a Google Sheet integration, you can save yourself the hassle of repeatedly going back and forth between your sheets and Viva Goals to update your progress on KRs: Viva Goals will sync the values for you, thus saving time while keeping your OKRs current.
  
All users and admins can use this feature. Admins can manage the integration from the admin dashboard.

## How to enable Google Sheets integration

Admins can follow these steps to enable this integration:

1. From the sidebar, go to **Admin** and select the **Integrations** tab.

2. For **Google Sheets**, you'll have an option to **Enable** the integration. If you already created a connection, you'll have an option to **Manage** the integration.
  
   You can also disable the integration from the same section: Go to **Change** and select **Disable integration** from the dropdown.

## For admins: How to connect Google Sheets to your Viva Goals account

1. After you enable the integration as an admin, you need to configure a Google Sheets connection from the **Google Sheets configuration** page.

2. Select **New Connection**, and sign in to your Google account.

3. Allow Viva Goals to access the below scopes
    a. See and download all Google Drive files
    b. See, edit, create, and delete all you Google Sheets spreadsheets

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that because Google Sheets lacks a granular scope to read the drive files, Viva Goals requires access to expanded scopes as described in step #3. Viva Goals won't be able to manage your Google Drive files other than reading them from your Google Drive or shared drive. 

4. Enter a name for the connection.

5. It's optional to share this connection with other users in the organization. Select **Next** to get up and running with this integration. You can edit the saved connection at any time.

6. Viva Goals allows you to connect with multiple Google Sheets. Select **New Connection** to fetch data from another sheet. You differentiate these connections by name. The names will be displayed to other users when they link their OKRs with Google Sheets data.

## How to use Google Sheets integration and connect Google Sheets to an OKR

After you configure the connection, the next step is link OKRs to your Google Sheet.

1. When you create or edit a Key Result, select **Automatically from a data source**. From the drop-down menu, select **Google Sheets**.

2. If you already created a connection, or if your administrator shared a connection with you, that connection will be selected automatically. Viva Goals will prompt you to create a new connection only if there are no connections already created or shared.

3. Select the **spreadsheet** you want to use, followed by the **sheet**, **column**, and **row number** of the cell you would like to link to the metric.

4. Select an **Next** to save your key result.

## How to disable Google Sheets integration

Admins can disable Google Sheets integration at any time: Go to **Google Sheets** in the **Integrations** section and select **Manage**. On the **Google Sheets Configurations** page, go to the **Change** dropdown, select **Disable**, and confirm.
