# Share OKR summary via Slack  

Owners or managers of OKRs always want to share their OKRs with their team or to update executives on their progress. With the help of the [Microsoft Viva Goals app for Slack](https://goals.microsoft.com/slack_bot/install), users can share a list of OKRs with another user via [Slack](https://slack.com/) or in a public Slack channel with a note or can ask a colleague to update an OKR.

### Share an OKR summary of a team or user

 To share summary from the OKRs page, click the **Share** icon on the top right corner of the page and select **Share Summary.**

Enter user emails or Slack channels (if Microsoft Viva Goals app for Slack is enabled for the organization) that you want to share the OKRs on the recipients field. You can also choose to share the update to all the users who are following the team by checking the **Include followers...** checkbox.
