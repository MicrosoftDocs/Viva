# Trial Checklist 

Looking for step-by-step guidance on how to evaluate Viva Goals during a trial? We've provided some tips for running a successful trial, as well as a two-part validation checklist to make your trial experience run smoothly. 

## How to run a successful trial

Trials can be a great way to evaluate software solutions for your organization, leading to faster decision-making and the ability to move your business forward more quickly. 

To keep things easy, here are three key elements to consider when running your trial: 

1. **Clearly define the objectives** 
 Before starting a trial, it's essential to identify what you want to achieve as your end result. To do so, outline specific objectives that you want to accomplish and ensure that these align with the needs of your business. This helps you measure the effectiveness of the software and determine whether it meets your expectations. 

2. **Engage with users**
 To achieve success, it's important to involve the right people. Identify key stakeholders who will be using the software in their daily operations. This could include senior leadership, department leaders, and end users. Encourage feedback from these individuals throughout the trial period to identify any issues or areas for improvement. This feedback helps you define any questions you need to validate and ensure that the software meets the needs of your business. 

3. **Utilize available support and resources**
 When evaluating anything new, invariably you have questions. Ensure that trial users have access to any necessary resources and support during the trial. This could include online training materials, such as the checklist weâ€™ve provided below. 

## Using Trial Checklists for Microsoft Viva Goals

To help users make the most of their trial, two checklists have been developed: Trial Configuration and Trial Validation. 

Each checklist has a slightly different purpose, and is designed to be used together, with the Trial Configuration Checklist first to explore features, followed by the Trial Validation Checklist to answer big picture questions. 


|Checklist   |Purpose  |How to use   |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Trial Configuration      |Understand how to configure and use the core features within Viva Goals.          |Progress through the checklist and use test data or real-world examples from your organization to practice using key features in Viva Goals. View step-by-step instructions and videos to assist you.          |
|Trial Validation      |Understand the top considerations when validating if Viva Goals add value and be a good fit for your company.          |Read through the questions to see if there are any blockers or unanswered questions that need to be addressed before moving from the validation to launch phase.          |

By using these checklists, organizations can make the most of their trial period, reduce time spent on the validation process, and make an informed decision to move forward.
