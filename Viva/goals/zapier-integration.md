# Zapier integration

Viva Goals integration with Zapier enables you to connect Viva Goals with all the tools you use every day. Say, for instance, you have an OKR to 'Preview mobile app with 5 enterprise customers', you can directly link this objective with a Trello card where you're tracking your thought Beta Customers, so with every checklist item update, a check-in is made automatically to the OKR in Viva Goals.

## Setting up  

How to connect an app of your choice with Viva Goals:

1. Navigate to https://zapier.com/app/zaps and sign-in.
1. Select on **Create Zap** and start by selecting an app for the Zap’s trigger. Go on to choose the app’s trigger event and connect with Trello as we're tracking Beta customers for our mobile app as a checklist in Trello. Once you’re done setting up your trigger, select on **Continue** to set up the action.

1. After logging in, you'll get sent back to your zap where you now have your Viva Goals account connected.
1. Choose the Key Result to which you want to connect, select the metric’s progress that should be tracked to make check-ins, and add additional notes or comments if any.
