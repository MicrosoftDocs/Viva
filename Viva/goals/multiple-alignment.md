# Multiple Alignment

Viva Goals recognizes that the modern workplace is often made up of nonlinear organizational structures and goal matrixes. The Multiple Alignment feature helps.

## What is Multiple Alignment?

The Multiple Alignment feature in Viva Goals lets Viva Goal users align a single OKR to two or OKRs above it in the organization.

Multiple-aligned objectives are easy to distinguish from the rest. See the double-arrow icon.

## How to use Multiple Alignment

If Multiple Alignment is enabled, you align in the same manner as single alignment, but you can select multiple objectives.

In this image, you can see the alignment to both **Culture Communication** and **Deliver Project Y by first week of December**.

If an objective is aligned to multiple objectives, the progress roll-up will cascade normally. You're simply contributing to both objectives at a higher level.

## When to use Multiple Alignment

- Users can use Multiple Alignment if there's an individual objective that contributes to two separate team objectives.

- To group similar individual objectives that are separately aligned to teams above into a single individual objective. The functionality improves the focus of your personal dashboard.

## Multiple Alignment and Private Objectives

You can enable both the Multiple Alignment and [Private Objectives](private-objectives-key-results.md) features at the same time, with the following restrictions:

- A Multiple Alignment public OKR can be made private, but all of the alignment will first be automatically removed.

- No key result of a private objective can use Multiple Alignment.
