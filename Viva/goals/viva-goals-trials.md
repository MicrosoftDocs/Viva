# Viva Goals trials overview

You can use a Viva Goals trial to let your organization try out all the features of Viva Goals before paying for the full product. Trials aren't permanent, but they're a useful way to determine whether Viva Goals would meet your goal management needs. There are two ways to start a trial: you can have your IT admin start it for you, or you can use a self-service trial.

The following pages can help you get started:

- [Use an IT admin-led trial to try out the full version of Viva Goals](it-admin-trials.md): Guidance on how to start and run an IT admin-led trial.

- [Use a self-service trial to try out the full version of Viva Goals](self-service-trials.md): Guidance on how to start and run a self-service trial.

- [Trial checklist](trials-checklist.md): A step-by-step guide for running and validating a Viva Goals trial, including best practices.
