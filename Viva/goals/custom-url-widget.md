# Embed URL widget

During OKR reviews, teams often need to embed external content from documents, slides and images into their review dashboard. Embedding content easily bridges comprehensive data and visualizations from different mediums into Viva Goals so leaders can run effective executive reviews and team meetings.  The custom embed widget allows users to embed URLs so that they can be directly accessed from their Viva Goals dashboard. 

## Using the Embed URL feature 

1. In the dashboards tab, create a new widget. Select “Customized Embed”
 :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/custom-url-widget-images/custom-embed-widget.png" alt-text="Screenshot of highlighted custom ember widget in a review dashboard."::: 
1. Enter a title for the widget and paste the URL. If the URL is approved, the user sees a preview of their URL.

 > [!NOTE]
 > If a URL is blocked, users can contact their global admin for the allowlisted domains. Currently, the global admin can control the allow list of domains from a list of 183 allowlisted domains.
3. After clicking save, the embedded URL will appear in the dashboard widget.
