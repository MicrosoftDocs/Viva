# Excel Online integration

## Introduction to Excel Online integration

Viva Goals Excel Online integration lets you  update your objective and key results (OKR) progress automatically based on the values of specific cells in Microsoft Excel worksheets. 
  
Let's use this example: You use Excel Online to track the revenue generated by the sales team. You have an objective in Viva Goals to achieve $3M ARR for a quarter. When you link this objective to the corresponding sheet in Excel Online, the status of your OKR will be updated automatically as the value in the cell changes. You won't have to switch back and forth between your sheets and Viva Goals to update progress.

## How to enable Excel Online integration

To enable the integration, admins can follow these steps:

1. From the sidebar, go to **Admin** and select the **Integrations** tab.

1. For Excel Online, select to **Enable** the integration. If a connection was made previously or if the integration was already enabled, you'll have the option to **Manage** the enabled integration.

    You can disable this integration from the same section: Go to **Change** and select **Disable integration** from the dropdown.

## How to configure the Excel Online connection

After you enable the integration, the next step is to configure an Excel Online connection.

1. Select **New Connection**, and sign in to your Excel account.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/9/excel-new-connection-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where you select the option to create a new connection." lightbox="../media/goals/9/excel-new-connection-button.png":::

1. Provide a name for the connection.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/9/excel-configure-new-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where you enter a name for your new Excel Online connection." lightbox="../media/goals/9/excel-configure-new-connection.png":::

1. It's optional to share this connection with other users in the organization. Select **Next** to get running with this integration. You can edit the saved connection at any time.

Viva Goals lets you connect to multiple Excel sheets. Select **New Connection** to fetch data from another sheet. You differentiate these connections by name. The names will be displayed to other users when they link their OKRs with Excel Online data.

## How to connect the Excel Online connection to an OKR

After you configure the connection, the next step is to link OKRs to Excel sheets:

1. When you create or edit an OKR, select **Connect data source to auto-update progress**. From the drop-down menu, select **Excel Online**.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/9/select-excel-datasource.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where you select Excel Online from the list of data sources." lightbox="../media/goals/9/select-excel-datasource.png":::

1. If you already created a connection or if your admin shared a connection with you, that connection will be selected automatically. Viva Goals will prompt you to create a new connection only if there are no connections created or shared.

1. Select the method you want to use to measure progress, percent complete or key performance indicator (KPI). If you choose KPI, provide a metric, starting value, and target value.

1. Select a connection and a **Workbook**. As soon as you select the workbook, the associated sheets will be displayed in the **Sheet** dropdown menu. Select a worksheet.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/9/excelonline-connection-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where you select a workbook and worksheet for your new Excel Online connection." lightbox="../media/goals/9/excelonline-connection-details.png":::

1. To locate the cell accurately, enter the **Column** and the **Row Number**.

   Progress will be calculated based on the number present in the chosen cell, if you chose KPI metric to track progress. It will be calculated based on the percentage accomplished if you chose percent complete to track progress.

1. Select **Next** and then **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> The sync will happen once every hour. To trigger the sync manually, select the Excel Online icon next to the progress bar of the objective, and then select the sync icon.

You've now linked your objective to a worksheet in Excel Online to track the cell value and update the status of the corresponding OKR automatically.

The colors of the progress bar in Viva Goals indicate the status of the objective:

- If the progress is 0 to 25 percent less than the expected progress at any point in time, the OKR status is *behind*, and the progress bar will be orange.

- If the progress is more than 25-percent less than expected at any point, the OKR status is *at risk*, and the progress bar will be red.
