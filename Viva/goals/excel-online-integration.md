# Excel Online integration

Viva Goals Excel Online integration lets you update OKR progress automatically based on the values of specific cells in Microsoft Excel worksheets.
  
As an example, let's say you use Excel Online to track the revenue generated by your sales team. One of your key results in Viva Goals is to achieve $3M ARR for a quarter. When you link this key result to the corresponding sheet in Excel Online, the status of your OKR will be updated automatically as the value in the cell changes. You won't have to switch back and forth between your sheets and Viva Goals to update progress.

## Enable Excel Online integration

To enable the integration, admins can follow these steps:

1. From the sidebar, go to **Admin** and select the **Integrations** tab.

1. Under **Data Integrations**, find Excel Online and select **Enable** to enable the integration. If a connection was made previously or if the integration has already been enabled, it will say **Manage** instead of **Enable**.

    You can disable this integration from the Excel Online Configuration page you accessed by selecting **Manage**: simply select **Change** > **Disable Integration**.

## Configure an Excel Online connection

After you enable the integration, the next step is to configure an Excel Online connection.

1. Go to **Admin** > **Integrations** and select **Manage** next to Excel Online.

1. Select **New Connection** and sign in to your Excel account.

1. Provide a name for the connection.

1. Select **Next** to begin working with Excel Online through this connection. You can edit the saved connection at any time.

Viva Goals lets you connect to multiple Excel sheets. Select **New Connection** to fetch data from another sheet. You differentiate these connections by name. The names will be displayed to other users when they link their OKRs with Excel Online data.

## Connect an Excel Online connection to an OKR

After you configure the connection, the next step is to link OKRs to Excel sheets:

1. When you create or edit a key result, open the Progress and Status dropdown. In the section with the text "Connect to a data source for automatic progress updates", find and select the icon for **Excel Online**.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/9/select-excel-datasource.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where you select Excel Online from the list of data sources." lightbox="../media/goals/9/select-excel-datasource.png":::

1. If you already created a connection or if your admin shared a connection with you, that connection will be selected automatically. Viva Goals will prompt you to create a new connection only if there are currently no created or shared connections.

1. Select the method you want to use to measure progress: percent complete or key performance indicator (KPI). If you choose KPI, provide a metric, starting value, and target value.

1. Select a connection and a **Workbook**. As soon as you select the workbook, the associated sheets will be displayed in the **Sheet** dropdown menu. Select a worksheet.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/goals/9/excelonline-connection-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where you select a workbook and worksheet for your new Excel Online connection." lightbox="../media/goals/9/excelonline-connection-details.png":::

1. To specify the desired cell accurately, enter the **Column** and the **Row Number**.

   If you chose to track progress using the KPI metric, progress will be calculated based on the number present in the chosen cell. If you chose to track progress based on percent complete, it will be calculated based on the percentage accomplished.

1. Select **Save** to save your connection, then select **Save** in the **Edit Key Result** dialog to finalize your changes to the OKR.

> [!NOTE]
> The sync will happen once every hour. To trigger the sync manually, select the **Excel Online** icon next to the key result's progress bar, then select **Sync**.

You've now linked your key result to a worksheet in Excel Online; the appropriate cell value will now be tracked, and the status of the corresponding OKR will be updated automatically as appropriate.

The colors of the progress bar in Viva Goals indicate the status of the key result:

- If the progress is 0 to 25 percent less than the expected progress at any point in time, the OKR status is *behind*, and the progress bar will be orange.

- If the progress is more than 25-percent less than expected at any point, the OKR status is *at risk*, and the progress bar will be red.
