# The five OKR superpowers

OKRs provide a framework to allow large and small companies set goals, stay agile, and ensure employees are on board with the latest strategy through the five superpowers that are described in the following table.

|Superpower name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Focus     |    OKRs require the selection of just 3-5 goals per quarter, pushing organizations to focus on only the work that matters and to make hard choices to eliminate tasks that *don't* matter.     |
|Alignment     |   OKRs help align company goals from top to bottom so that everyone is rowing in the same direction.       |
|Tracking     |   OKRs are data-driven. Today's most successful companies use data to inform action and guide strategic decisions.      |
|Transparency     |   A core tenet of OKRs is that employees can view goals and progress at every level, from CEO to individual contributor, fostering accountability and collaboration.      |
|Stretch   |    When employees are encouraged to set,  stretch goals to achieve what might not seem possible and are supported by a growth-mindset culture, learning and innovation accelerate.     |
